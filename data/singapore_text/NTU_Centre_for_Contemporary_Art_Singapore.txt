Title: NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore

For a more in-depth perspective on appreciating art, drop by the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore (NTU CCA Singapore), a research centre belonging to tertiary institution Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

Located at the contemporary arts cluster of Gillman Barracks, the venue regularly hosts events centring on contemporary art including exhibitions, live performances, film screenings, open studios and talks by visiting artists and curators. Past events have included Stagings. Sounds. Readings. Free Jazz II—which interrogates modern environmental issues through free-spirited, multi-disciplinary performances— and Trees of Life, a deep dive into plants native to Asia and central to the region’s identity.

The programme line-up brings together established international and local artists, and each exhibition is accompanied by public events that provide deeper insight to the shows.

The other two areas of the NTU CCA Singapore are Residencies and Research & Education, which focus primarily on biology, habitats and the environment.

A home to international art

While you’re here, don’t forget to explore the rest of the 6.4-hectare Gillman Barracks, which contains 11 international galleries housed in conserved colonial barracks. This arts enclave also hosts Art After Dark, a series of late night open house events. These events happen throughout the year, with a flagship edition taking place every January, in conjunction with Singapore Art Week.
