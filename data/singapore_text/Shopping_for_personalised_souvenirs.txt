Title: Shopping for personalised souvenirs

With everything from the biggest international brands to home-grown boutiques, shoppers visiting Singapore are spoilt for choice. But why settle for what’s on the shelf when you can walk home with an item that’s designed perfectly for you?

Whether it’s a bespoke suit, customisable notebook, or personalised scent, it’s hard to beat the satisfaction that comes with pieces tailor-made to your taste. Here are six stores selling items that are bound to express your individuality.

Bynd Artisan

Established in 1947, this family-run business is famous for its high-quality leather-bound books, which make for practical and gorgeous gifts. Picking out your purchase is an experience in itself. Begin by choosing from a range of leatherette covers and papers, then let your personal taste shine by mixing and matching the little details, like binding wires, leather flaps, and snap buttons. In just a few minutes, the expert craftsmen will bind your selections for a creation that will express your unique sense of aesthetics. Prices are also reasonable for a bespoke piece, with their bestselling customisable A5 notebook starting at just S$20. Bynd Artisan. 44 Jalan Merah Saga #01-54, Singapore 278116. +65 6475 1680.
