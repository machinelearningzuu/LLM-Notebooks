Title: Indian Heritage Centre

LITTLE INDIA GUIDE TO THE BEST SINGAPORE MUSEUMS

The four-storey Indian Heritage Centre fuses traditional and modern architectural elements. Inspired by the stepwells in India, the unique glass façade is a large mirror by day and turns transparent at night to reveal a ‘glowing lantern’ of the façade’s colourful mural. The centre showcases Indian culture and history, and houses a permanent exhibition titled, ‘Indians in Singapore - Past & Present’. Through the displays and with the help of audio guides and augmented reality technology, visitors will discover connections between South Asia and Southeast Asia, and gain a better understanding of the Indian community in Singapore.

The centre also provides venues ideal for conducting events, seminars and workshops. Grab a Little India Heritage Trail booklet from its Visitor Services Counter and embark on three specially curated thematic routes around the Little India neighbourhood that features over 40 heritage sites. The trail is available till 8 July 2020
