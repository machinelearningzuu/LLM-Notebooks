Title: Singapore Flyer

A giant observation wheel that stands amidst the skyscrapers in the Singapore skyline, the Singapore Flyer is the go-to attraction for the most magnificent views of our city.

A scenic spin on the Singapore Flyer takes you 165 metres above ground, or as high as 42 storeys, as you marvel at the spectacular scenery below.

City sights and unparalleled vistas

Located in the heart of downtown Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer is Asia's largest giant observation wheel.



More importantly, it is high on thrills for tourists and locals alike. Step into one of the 28 fully air-conditioned glass capsules, and be transported on a 30-minute journey of stunning day and night scenes.

From this glorious vantage point, you’ll be able to feast your eyes on iconic and historical sights from Marina Bay to the Singapore River, such as Raffles Place, Merlion Park, Empress Place and the Padang.



With any luck, you’ll be able to spot landmarks up to 45km away, like Changi Airport, Sentosa Island and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia.

Elevated dining experiences

Indulge in an exquisite four-course dinner, sip on premium champagne or host a canapés party while savouring breathtaking waterfront views of Marina Bay skyline.

Back on the ground, be sure to visit dining options like Sky View Pavilion—which serves up a spread of contemporary Cantonese dishes—and Red Chillies for authentic Indian fare.
