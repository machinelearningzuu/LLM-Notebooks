Title: Meet Singaporean bartender Sasha Wijidessa

Meet

Sasha

Bartender, Artisan

To some, bartending is a career. To Sasha Wijidessa, it is a calling. The third of four children, Sasha bucked her parents’ expectations of a career in the pharmaceutical industry, choosing instead the rigours and joys of bartending.

Formerly a waitress, she was headhunted by her mentor and award-winning bartender Luke Whearty. The young talent turned her innate artistry—and her diploma in pharmaceutical science—towards her newfound passion, creating a menu of natural wines through her knowledge of distillation.

Now a veteran of the craft, Sasha dreams of having her own space to create cocktails that fuel new connections, and straddle the boundaries of art and science.
