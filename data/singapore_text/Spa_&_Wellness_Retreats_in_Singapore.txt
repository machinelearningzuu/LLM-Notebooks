Quirky ways to relax and recharge

nimble/knead

While you normally wouldn’t associate food with spas, nimble/knead — located in the hip enclave of Tiong Bahru—merges the two into a truly unique experience.

Besides traditional treatments like Thai and Swedish massages, the spa also offers a range of food-themed body scrubs and face masks. This includes their Chocolicious body scrub—which uses chocolate powder and cocoa seed to improve blood circulation— and Lemongrassade, which closes pores and tightens the skin.

nimble/knead. 66 Eng Watt Street #01-28, Singapore 160066. +65 6438 3933.

Daily 11am-10pm.

Passage New York

Why pick between spa treatments and retail therapy when you can have both at the same place? Passage New York is the first establishment in Singapore to boast both spa amenities and a fashion atelier in the same space.

Indulge in the range of personalised treatments—such as the Caviar Anti-Aging Face Spa— then treat yourself to a range of accessories, shopping bags and dresses at their fashion boutique on the first floor.

Keck Seng Tower. 133 Cecil Street #01-01, Singapore 069535. +65 6226 0888.

Mon-Fri 11am-9.30pm; Sat 10am-6pm.

Spaces of nature and rejuvenation

Aramsa Spa An ideal space for nature lovers, each of Aramsa Spa’s 17 rooms boasts an individual outdoor courtyard, set against a backdrop of tropical flora. As you’d imagine, the services here centre primarily on nature-based therapy, which includes mineral garden baths, exfoliation and massages that employ herb-based ointments. We suggest timing your visit to conclude in the evening, so that you can take a walk around Bishan Park after your session. Budding birdwatchers will be able to expand their encyclopediac knowledge of avian wildlife by keeping an eye out for purple herons and white-breasted waterhens. Aramsa Spa at Bishan Park 2. 1384 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Singapore 569932. +65 6456 6556.
