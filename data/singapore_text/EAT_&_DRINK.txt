Title: EAT & DRINK

Fun after sunset

Singapore’s nightlife scene has exploded into a dizzying whirl of music, drink and entertainment that caters to both party animals and those seeking a quieter night out – all around the clock. Dance to the beats of world-class DJs at a megaclub, enjoy a bespoke tipple at a discreet cocktail bar or check out a live band before having a big laugh at a comedy club. Crank up the volume or dial it down to a more comfortable pace. The choices are limited only by your imagination, and how long you take to recover the next day.
