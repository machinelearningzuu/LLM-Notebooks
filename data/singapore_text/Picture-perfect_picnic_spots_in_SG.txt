Title: Picture-perfect picnic spots in SG

While Singapore is certainly a bustling city, it’s also home to tranquil hideaways and lush green spaces that are perfect for picnics on lazy afternoons. Enjoy the tropical weather, bask in the sunshine and read on for our guide to the top places in the Lion City to have a picnic.

Sentosa

If your ideal image of a weekend afternoon involves white sands and pristine waters, make a beeline for Sentosa and its trio of beaches. Lay your mat out right next to the sea and sunbathe along Tanjong Beach, or work up a sweat with a round of volleyball at Siloso Beach.

Sentosa is also home to myriad beachside bars and cafes, which make for convenient pitstops to get your grub. If you’re looking for thrills and spills after getting your dose of tranquillity, be sure to drop by HydroDash or Skypark Sentosa.

If you’re planning an outing in the evening, we suggest visiting Palawan Green as an alternative—You’ll be treated to magnificent sunset views of the South China Sea.
