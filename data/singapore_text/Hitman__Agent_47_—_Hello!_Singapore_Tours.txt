Title: Hitman: Agent 47 — Hello! Singapore Tours

HITMAN: AGENT 47 centers on an elite assassin who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research - and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.

MOVIE LOCATIONS: What’s crazier than a crowded CBD? The CBD plus an exciting car chase sequence. The shoot-out was filmed at a blue Comfort Cab-filled Robinson Road. There’s also a glimpse of the now-closed MPH bookstore in the background. Rumour has it that lead actor RupertFriend was the first civilian to legally fire a gun in Singapore. Places like Changi Airport, Chinatown and Gardens by the Bay also had their fair share of screentime.
