Title: Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore

If you are a supporter of creativity and innovation, drop by the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore (ICA Singapore), a art space given over to exploring new and experimental art.

The curatorial division of private arts institution LASALLE College of the Arts, this art space contains five galleries spread over 1500-square-metres of space. Students of the College also regularly exhibit in the galleries as part of their graduating shows, showcasing paintings, sculptures and installations to videos and photographs.

A variety of genresâ€”from fine arts and design to media practices and performing arts are showcased here. Its programme focuses on displaying the works of international and local contemporary arts and artists. Besides a regular line-up of artists presenting their works here, the ICA Singapore regularly collaborates with international organisations, artists and guest curators and is a member of the Asian Arts Space Network (AASN).

An education in the arts

ICA Singapore's public programme includes seminars and symposiums, talks by artists and curators and events of contemporary performance, installation, design and music/sound practices. Its aim is to provide a channel for both students and the public to gain a deeper understanding and awareness of contemporary local, regional and international arts.

ICA Singapore's publications such as art catalogues, art critiques and reviews of the art landscape in Singapore are produced and available throughout the year, in conjunction with exhibitions and events.
