Title: Night activities for families

If you thought Singapore was great for family activities during the day, wait until you see the city after dark. Whether you are a parent who just wants to kick back with an arts performance, or have kids who are budding astronomers, there are plenty of fun activities for the whole family.

Speed down the Skyline Night Luge Sentosa

Skyline Night Luge Sentosa is a whole different experience from the daytime version of the luge, a sled-like cart that allows you to zip down a purpose-built 1.4-kilometre-long track. You will be treated to the Wings of Time fireworks show as you ride the chairlift up to the starting point of the track. Feel the wind in your hair as you descend the slopes on the Jungle or Dragon tracks in an easy-to-steer cart, which allows kids as young as six to ride alone. You can also ride in tandem with your kid, so long as they are between 85 to 110 centimetres tall. Parents should take note that the last run at Skyline Night Luge Sentosa begins at approximately 9.20pm every Friday and Saturday. Visitors are strongly encouraged to book tickets in advance to secure a slot. Sentosa. 45 Siloso Beach Walk, Sentosa, Singapore 099003. +65 6274 0472.

Mon, Tue, Thu & Sun 11am-7.30pm; Fri & Sat 11am-9.30pm.

Stargaze at The Observatory, Science Centre Singapore

As one of the few observatories located near the Equator, The Observatory at the Science Centre Singapore offers visitors the unique experience of observing the stars in both the Northern and Southern celestial hemispheres. Children will enjoy spotting planets such as Venus, Jupiter and Saturn (visibility depends on the time of the year) through the observatory’s telescope, while older folks can choose to just sit back and gaze at the night sky through the Observatory’s dome. Science Centre Singapore. 15 Science Centre Road, Singapore 609081. +65 6425 2500.

Every Friday 7.45-10pm.

Appreciate art and performances at the ArtScience Museum™

The ArtScience Museum™ extends its opening hours every third Thursday of the month to host free performances, late-night exhibition viewings, and one-for-one entry to exhibitions. Music, dance and multimedia arts are just a few of the disciplines that have been featured in the programme. Your children will be enthralled by these after-dark performances, as they often include some form of audience interaction. The shows’ past performers include Singaporean beatboxer Charles “Stitch” Wong, local art rock band The Observatory and Japanese performance artist Yuzuru Maeda. ArtScience Museum™. 6 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018974. +65 6688 8888.

Third Thursday of every month 7-10pm.

Carve the ice at Kallang Ice World

Leisure Park Kallang is more than your typical shopping mall–it’s home to Kallang Ice World, Singapore’s largest ice skating rink. Kids who aren’t that comfortable on the ice, and are below 1.2-metres tall, can borrow free skate aids from the counter.

Parents who’d rather keep an eye on their kids from afar can get comfortable on the gallery-style seating around the rink. There are also different levels of ice skating classes available during the day. Prices (S$15-S$17.50) include skate rental only, with gloves and socks sold separately (S$2-S$2.50).

Leisure Park Kallang. 5 Stadium Walk Level 3, Singapore 397693. +65 6348 1123.

Mon-Thu & Sun 10am-10pm; Fri-Sat 10am-midnight.

Embark on adventure at the Night Safari

The world’s first nocturnal wildlife park is home to over 1,000 nocturnal animals. Spread across six geographical zones, you can take the tram, or if your kid is up for a night stroll, embark on the walking trails to visit them all. Check out the new Wallaby Trail, which is inspired by the Australian Outback and highland forests, to see possums, tawny frogmouths and, of course, the namesake marsupials. If you’re visiting during weekend, be sure to catch the 20-minute Creatures of the Night Show, which features wolves howling, African servals leaping for food, and otters performing tricks. Night Safari. 80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826. +65 6269 3411.

Daily 7.15pm-midnight.

Catch and grill your own prawns at ORTO

Looking for a late-night activity that the whole family can enjoy? Why not do as the locals do and try your hand at prawning? ORTO is one of the few multi-recreational parks that are open 24/7, and there are a total of ten freshwater ponds in the compound, filled mainly with big head prawns and yabbies to catch.

You can even grill your haul on the premises at no additional charge. If you’re looking for a heartier meal, there are five on-site eateries available—including Thai BBQ restaurant Mookata, which operates until the wee hours.

ORTO. 81 Lorong Chencharu, Singapore 769198. +65 8518 7088.
