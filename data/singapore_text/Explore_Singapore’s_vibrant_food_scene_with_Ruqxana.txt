Title: Explore Singapore’s vibrant food scene with Ruqxana

Meet

Ruqxana

Culinary instructor, Self-taught chef

As a child, Ruqxana Vasanwala expressed her love for food by hoarding recipes in a scrapbook. But her lifelong love for cooking only manifested as a career in 2001, when the dotcom bubble burst and ended her online business. Ruqxana took a leap of faith, and embarked on a journey that began in her own kitchen. Thus, Cookery Magic was born.

Since then, the self-taught chef and culinary instructor has helped hundreds of people—hailing from all walks of life—to discover the joys of food. Cookery Magic welcomes visitors with authentic stories about Singapore’s rich culinary traditions and joyous adventures in the realm of food.
