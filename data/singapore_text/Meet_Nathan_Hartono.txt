Title: Meet Nathan Hartono

Meet

Nathan

Singaporean singer-songwriter

In 2016, Nathan captured the hearts of millions of music fans, when he clinched the title of runner-up at Chinese reality talent show, ‘Sing! China’. But the charismatic singer is no newcomer to the world of music: he cut his debut album at the young age of 15, and has been on the Singapore music circuit since.

With his soulful voice, sociable personality and guy-next-door charm, he has won the hearts of fans on stages across our island. Among his first few concerts were sold-out shows at Mosaic Music Festival, held at the Esplanade–Theatres on the Bay. This still-rising star has begun to flex his many talents, having already ventured into musicals and acting—he most recently performed as one of the lead musical cast on The Great Wall: One Woman's Journey, he can also be seen on HBO’s Halfworlds.
