Title: Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore

If you’re a cruise passenger coming into Singapore, you can’t miss the massive cruise ships berthing at the new Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore (MBCCS).

There are great photo opportunities, with some of the world's mega ships, setting a majestic backdrop.

‘Waves’ on the rooftop

Look down and you’ll see the terminal’s innovative design. Notice its angular form and rolling rooftop ‘waves’ that appear to constantly change as you get closer.

This architectural icon offers impressive views of the downtown Singapore skyline and the Straits of Singapore.

Its waterfront location at Marina Bay brings you closer to attractions such as Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage as well as the business financial centre and Marina Bay Sands®.

Promising a seamless experience

The MBCCS boasts top-notch facilities and its two-berth facility can accommodate up to 6,800 passengers at any one time.

If you’re flying off after your cruise, consider the CruiseFly service. The region’s first sea-to-air baggage transfer service allows early check-in for flights departing within the same day of your ship’s arrival into Singapore, and lets you check in, deposit your bags and collect your boarding passes minus the hassle.
