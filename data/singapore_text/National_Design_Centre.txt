Title: National Design Centre

The National Design Centre (NDC) is a treasure trove of design exhibitions, learning and resources that will inspire even the casual design enthusiast.

You can drop by the NDC to view a furniture exhibition or attend a seminar on how design can transform a business. Or maybe take your kids to an event that will challenge the little ones’ senses and extend their sense of curiosity.

The NDC occupies the 120-year-old premises of the former St. Anthony’s Convent. The development of the NDC comprises the restoration and adaptive re-use of the conservation buildings, consisting of three pre-war Art Deco blocks and one post-war Modern block.

NDC is also home to DesignSingapore Council—the national agency for design. The Council develops the design sector, and helps Singapore to use design for innovation and growth.

Stylish shopping

If you wish to further indulge in good design, check out kapok NDC, an offshoot of the Hong Kong-based cult lifestyle and design boutique, which is located on the ground floor. The 2,300-square-foot store stocks clothes, shoes, bags and accessories from Singapore and the rest of the world. After a session of shopping, rest your legs at Tanuki Raw, and indulge in refreshing cocktails and hearty, Japanese-inspired rice bowls.
