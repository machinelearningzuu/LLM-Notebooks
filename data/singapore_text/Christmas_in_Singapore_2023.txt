Title: Christmas in Singapore 2023

Christmas in Singapore is a big celebration that gives us all another excuse to do what we love most—Eat and shop.

The famous shopping belt on Orchard Road is spectacularly lit up every December to ramp up the festive mood, and serves as a blazing reminder to hit the malls and indulge in shopping sprees.

Meanwhile, Christmas spreads and Yuletide menus pop up at restaurants across the island, giving a festive twist to an already impressive dining scene.

It’s not all indulgence though.

At its heart, the holiday is still a special day for Christians in Singapore, who attend Christmas service in commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a religious celebration like any other, and regardless of your religious beliefs, everyone gets to take part in the fun of frolicking in artificial snow, men in Santa suits and of course, Christmas presents!
