Title: The Best Camera Kit For Travel (Updated 2021)

Over the years, we have put together what we think is a good quality camera kit for travel. While we need the kit to be as small and light as possible, the most important thing is that it can capture excellent images as well as video.

We also need our camera kit to function well in quite rough weather conditions. It has to work equally well on a hike among snow-capped mountain peaks, as on a walk through the streets of Tokyo. Below is our current camera kit as of 2021.
