Title: Potato Head & Three Buns Singapore — Hello! Singapore Tours

Housed in a conserved shophouse from 1939, Potato Head Singapore brings a whimsical childhood touch to its historical surroundings on Keong Saik Road. The four-storied establishment offers two spaces for serious and casual drinking–Studio 1939, a decadent drinking den with an ever-evolving cocktail menu, and The Rooftop, an open-air rooftop bar with tropical cocktails and a city view. Try its ZOMBIE 36 (S$22++), a refreshing mix of the bar’s 5-rum blend with tropical fruit flavours.

It also has two spaces catered to dining, as part of its Three Buns Restaurant that offers Asian-fusion burgers like beef rendang (braised meat cooked in coconut milk and spices) burgers. Minimum spending is applicable to groups of ten and above visiting Potato Head & Three Buns Singapore to reserve a table, rates will depend on the day and space of booking.
