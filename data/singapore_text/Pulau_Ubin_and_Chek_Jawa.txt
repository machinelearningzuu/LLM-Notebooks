Title: Pulau Ubin and Chek Jawa

The more adventurous can hike to the wetlands in about 40 minutes. The one-kilometre boardwalk along the coast is a convenient way to view the rich plant and marine life, while a 20-meter-tall viewing tower also gives visitors a chance to observe birds like the Collared Kingfisher and Straw-headed Bulbul. Guided tours are available, while educational information about Chek Jawa can be found at the Visitor Centre and viewing jetty.
