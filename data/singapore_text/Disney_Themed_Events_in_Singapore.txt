Title: Disney Themed Events in Singapore

A first for Disney in Southeast Asia, Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Disney began a three-year collaboration in 2017 that aimed to provide unique and fun experiences themed around Disney’s biggest brands and most popular stories and characters.

It started with STAR WARS DAY: MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU Festival that featured a plethora of events and activations, from the first-ever STAR WARS Run in Singapore to the “Sabertrees”, where the iconic Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay were transformed into lightsabers.

The following year, 15 larger-than-life sand sculptures featuring everyone’s favourite Super Heroes – and villains – took over the sands of Siloso Beach with Sentosa Sandsation: MARVEL Edition.

In 2019, beloved toys from Disney and Pixar’s Toy Story 4 took the spotlight at Gardens by the Bay’s Children’s Festival. With carnival games, a unique Toy Story 4-themed Garden Rhapsody, a giant marble track weaving through the Supertrees and special appearances by Woody and Buzz Lightyear, it was fun for fans of all ages!
