Welcome!

I’m Nina, a solo travel expert.

I discovered my love of solo travel when I moved to Italy at 16. Since then, I’ve lived on 3 continents, visited 29 countries, and became a digital nomad.

I started Nina Out and About to share my travel wisdom, and because my friends got tired of hearing my travel stories. Now I share my travel tips, guides, and funny mishaps to inspire other young women to turn their travel dreams into reality today!
