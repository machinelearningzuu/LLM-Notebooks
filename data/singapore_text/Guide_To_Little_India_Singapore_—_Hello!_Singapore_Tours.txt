Title: Guide To Little India Singapore — Hello! Singapore Tours

Open 24 hours, this one-stop mega shopping mall sells everything—a paradise for bargain hunters. Mustafa Centre is housed on six floors over a 37,161 sqm area. The sheer variety of items on sale is dizzying—from perfumes to wheelchairs to leather jackets, food items, sports shoes and everything else in between. There are six entrances: visitors are recommended to enter through Entrance 1 (on Syed Alwi Road), so they only have one direction to go.
