Title: Guide To The Best Singapore Museums — Hello! Singapore Tours

Located inside Fort Canning Hill, the Battlebox was once a top-secret bunker that was built to be bombproof and self- sufficient. Constructed in 1936, it served as an underground command centre for British-led troops in Singapore during World War II. It was also inside the Battlebox that the British made the momentous decision on 15 February 1942 to surrender Singapore to the Japanese forces.

Visitors can join The Battlebox Tour, which is held three to five times a day. Guides will take participants through the bunker’s historical functions and the events that led to the fall of Malaya and Singapore to the Japanese. Entry to Battlebox is via guided tours only.
