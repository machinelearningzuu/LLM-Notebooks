Title: Local Eats You'll Come Back For â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

WHEN/TIME: Private food tours can run on any day of the week. Food tours last 6 hours or 6.5 hours if you book the extra half an hour for hotel pick up. Private Singapore food tours can start at any time between 9 am and 3 pm.

STARTING POINT: Near the first food stop which is in the East Coast/Katong district of Singapore. Directions, maps and pictures for the meeting point are sent upon booking. If you add on an extra half an hour we can meet you in your hotel lobby.

END POINT: Little India (instructions on how to get back to your hotel or to your next activity will be provided by your guide).

DIETARY REQUIREMENTS: There is a wide variety of foods and ingredients in this tour. If you are unable to consume any of the following then it does mean that you will NOT be able to eat/drink everything on the tour: milk, meat, pork, prawns, fish, wheat/gluten, spice. If you are unable to consume several of those foods then you may prefer to opt for a customized tour rather than a food tour. We have taken people on the tour who have not been able to eat many of the foods and they have still enjoyed the tour as there is a lot of cultural and historical information but we would suggest that a non-food tour would be a better option.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: All tours take place come rain or shine. We strongly advise you to bring an umbrella as it does rain in Singapore on most days!
