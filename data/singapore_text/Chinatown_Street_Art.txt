Title: Chinatown Street Art

While Chinatown is known for its cultural landmarks and conserved shop-houses, visitors can also seek out the many murals that adorn the walls along the street. Mural artists such as Belinda Low, Ceno2, Didier Jaba Mathieu, Ripple Root, Tom Civil, and Yip Yew Chong have filled the walls of the streets around co-sharing spaces with scenes from old Singapore and old crafts and trades. Each mural provides visitors with Instagram-worthy photo opportunities that will surely stand out on their social media feed. To fully appreciate the artwork of local mural artist Yip Yew Chong, visitors can choose to embark on the Yip Yew Chong Street Art Trail by LocoMole.
