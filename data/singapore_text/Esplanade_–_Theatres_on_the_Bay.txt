Title: Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay

Pop by Esplanade at any time and you’ll find it hard not to be infected by its palpable creative vibe, whether it’s the ever-changing, larger than life visual arts display near the main entrance or the world-class performances staged here.

The shows featured cut across cultures and genres. You can catch a concert by Western greats such as The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra or a Chinese play inspired by the late doyen of Singapore Chinese theatre Kuo Pao Kun.

Fondly nicknamed "the Durian” by Singaporeans for its resemblance to the popular fruit, Esplanade holds a 1,600-seat Concert Hall, a 2,000-seat Theatre and several intimate performance venues. Its performance spaces have hosted a range of high-profile events, such as the return of the quintessential musical Les Misérables.

Free programmes, from music and dance to theatre, also regularly take place at various locations in Esplanade.

Shopping and dining

Before you attend a performance, catch a pre-show dinner or a coffee at one of the restaurants or cafes at the three-storey Esplanade Mall. You can also squeeze in a quick spot of shopping at the retail outlets, picking up goods as diverse as customised hand lotions, or maybe a violin or two.

If you wish to explore the complex further, take the Esplanade Tour, a 60-minute guided tour that takes you through the Concert Hall, Theatre and other front-of-house facilities. The tour will give you an understanding of the venue’s acoustics, its architecture and history, as well as its contribution to Singapore’s art scene.
