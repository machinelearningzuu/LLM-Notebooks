Title: Labrador Nature Reserve

Want to see local wildlife in their natural habitat while visiting the site of a genuine World War II (WWII) fort? That’s the kind of unique experience you're up for when you visit the Labrador Nature Reserve, home to 70 kinds of birds, 11 species of butterflies as well as numerous tree species.

It’s a rich forest of biodiversity that also happens to have played a part in Singapore’s military history. Here you'll discover fascinating historical war sites and points of interest, like a WWII fort, built in 1878 to defend Keppel Harbour.

For health fanatics, the park is interspaced with fitness stations. A jogging track that goes around the reserve also offers a scenic route for those looking to work out.

Labrador Nature Reserve is one of the parks connected via a nine-kilometre stretch of inter-connected open spaces known as the Southern Ridges, which spans other green areas such as Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Kent Ridge Park.
