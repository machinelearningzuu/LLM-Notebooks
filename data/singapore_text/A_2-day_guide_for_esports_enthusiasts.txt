Title: A 2-day guide for esports enthusiasts

Fuel up with a breakfast (or early lunch) of champions with a visit to Golden Mile Food Centre. Xian recommends eating his favourite pre-game dish of Hainanese boneless chicken rice , which is his “go-to meal” that he eats before travelling overseas for competitions.

Xian spent his youth playing retro games in arcades; to experience nostalgia reminiscent of the professional gamer’s formative years, drop by Retro Nutz, in the Rochor neighbourhood. This vintage game store stocks a range of old-school games, handheld video game consoles like Game Boy, and memorabilia from the good old days of arcades.

A neighbourhood that holds fond memory for Xian, Selegie is home to gaming cafes, LAN shops and various communal gaming establishments.

“My friend and I started a gaming cafe together called Tough Cookie Gaming Café,” Xian reminisces. “We used to stream games, shoot publicity videos and train there. It was like a training ground for me.”

While Tough Cookie Gaming Café has since closed its doors, the neighbourhood is still a great place to explore. LAN Cafes like Big O and Clique Gaming will give you the chance to engage in a bout of friendly competition with a host of online games, while those interested in traditional card and board games can visit either Mind Café or Play Nation.
