Title: Museum of Ice Cream Singapore

Forget about Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory—travellers craving a foray into a wonderland of sweet surprises should pay a visit to the Museum of Ice Cream (MOIC) Singapore instead.

Hailing from the United States of America, The Museum of Ice Cream boasts a who’s who of celebrity fans, including Beyonce, David Beckham and Katy Perry. This iconic attraction has now made its way to Singapore’s sunny shores, with its first-ever international launch.

Located within a 60,000 square foot colonial barracks in the neighbourhood of Dempsey, this pastel-coloured space comprises 14 multisensory and interactive installations to inspire the imagination. MOIC’s entertaining guides will take visitors on a 60 to 90-minute exploration through this enchanting space, with unlimited sweet treats to round off the experience.

Take a trip down memory lane at the Dragon Playground—inspired by the iconic playgrounds that dotted our island’s housing estates in the 1970s, and which still can be found in Toa Payoh—or frolic with friends and family amid the surreal pink and yellow hues of the Banana Jungle.

The space’s Sprinkle Pool—the largest ever created—is an ideal spot to make a splash on social media with a selfie or three, while the pink oasis at the California Beach is bound to delight both the young and the young at heart.

To end off the sweet experience, visitors may pick up goodies at the retail shop, enjoy an extra scoop at the café, or relax with a drink at the bar. You may also order online your favourite Museum of Ice Cream merchandise and delectable range of ice cream to be delivered straight to your home.
