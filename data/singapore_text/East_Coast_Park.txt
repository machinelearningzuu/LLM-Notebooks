Title: East Coast Park

Offering spaces for recreational cycling, rollerblading, fishing, skating, and dining, East Coast Park is themed ‘Recreation for All’ with leisure activities for every type of visitor. The 15-kilometer stretch of the beach is usually filled with people taking a stroll or jogging. At the Singapore Wake Park onlookers gather to watch cable-ski tricks, and the more adventurous can try knee-boarding, wakeboarding and wakeskating.
