The cruise centre is also just a short distance across the water from Sentosa Island, home to the world’s largest oceanarium, an elite golf club, Universal Studios Singapore, several world-class hotels and the Resorts World™ Sentosa.



Connect to the city easily

You’ll find easy connections – within mere minutes – to other shopping, dining and entertainment venues in the heart of the city with convenient underground train, taxi, limo or public buses. What’s more, Changi Airport is just a 20-minute cab-ride away.
