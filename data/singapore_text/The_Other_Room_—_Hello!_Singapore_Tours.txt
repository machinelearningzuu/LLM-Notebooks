Title: The Other Room — Hello! Singapore Tours

Taking a spot on the list of Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2019, The Other Room is helmed by multi-award-winning cocktail wizard Dario Knox. It is inspired by the darkness of the Prohibition Era and serves over 150 spirits finished in different ways. The bar is discreetly hidden behind black velvet drapes on the ground floor of the Singapore Marriott® Tang Plaza Hotel. Guests can savour The Balvenie Julep (S$23++), a bitter and refreshing concoction, or the Reversed Gin & Tonic (S$23++).

The majority of their drinks carry a punch as they are made with a higher amount of spirit proportion and guests are more than welcomed to ask the bartenders for classics or recommendations. Every Thursday night, ladies will enjoy complimentary oysters with bubb drinks from 8.30 pm onwards.
