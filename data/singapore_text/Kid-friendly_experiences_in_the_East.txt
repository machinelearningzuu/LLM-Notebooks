Title: Kid-friendly experiences in the East

Just a hop, skip and jump away from Changi Airport is the east area of Singapore. Those with kids in tow can rejoice—whether it’s outdoor parks or indoor cafés, there’s plenty here to keep the whole brood entertained.

Kaboodle

Help your child unleash their creativity and intelligence at Kaboodle, an indoor space that uses play as a medium to build, craft and experiment.

Beside a plethora of block puzzles, craft kits and colouring material, Kaboodle also organises holiday events like nerf gun and building competitions. Walk-ins are on a first-come, first served basis, so be sure to book on an appointment on their website before heading over!

Forest Adventure

Swing down a flying fox, teeter across a suspension bridge, or jump from a treetop at Forest Adventure, Singapore’s first and only tree top obstacle course. The young—and young-at-heart—can test their limits here with various courses, set amidst the foliage of Bedok Reservoir Park. The Kids Course comes with a continuous safety line, so be assured that your kid is in good hands. Those with a fear of heights can skate, run, cycle or even bird-watch at this tranquil spot.

This 120-seater café dishes out Western brunch classics like eggs benedict, fluffy buttermilk pancakes drenched in maple syrup and a hearty English-style breakfast.

While you’re digging in, your kids can spend their time romping in the space’s bouncy castle, or playing tag at the café’s lawn. Be sure to check out the restaurant’s kids club for tantalising offers, such as free dining for children on Mondays.

PAssion WaVe (Pasir Ris Park)

If you want some real outdoor adventure, travel to the far east of Singapore—and by that, we mean Pasir Ris, which sits at the end of the East-West MRT line.

Here, take a bus to PAssion WaVe which offers adventurous families a slew of water sports to try. Try kayaking or laser sailing on the seas (if you’re qualified), or combat the heights with abseiling and sport climbing. Families looking to relax can take a leisurely walk on the Mangrove Boardwalk—one of the two protected swamps in Singapore—which is home to native flora and fauna. Now, see if you can spot those mudskippers or mud crabs.

PAssion WaVe. 125 Elias Road, Singapore 519926. +65 6582 4796.
