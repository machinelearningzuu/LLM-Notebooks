Title: Meet Jahan Loh

Meet

Jahan

CONTEMPORARY ARTIST

You might know Jahan as the man who turned a ‘Ma Ling’ luncheon meat tin into pop art. This iconic artwork was last shown at B-Side and Rarities, an exhibition at Ion Art Gallery which showcased Jahan’s various works of the last decade. As the first artist to bring street art to galleries in both Singapore and China, Jahan has been credited for taking Singapore Pop Art international, and has influenced modern art practices in Taiwan. In 2011, his works were selected by the Andy Warhol Foundation to be showcased in Andy Warhol's exhibition, 15 Minutes Eternal, at the ArtScience Museum™.
