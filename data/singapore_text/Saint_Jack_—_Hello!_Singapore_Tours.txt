Title: Saint Jack â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

In the crime melodrama, Saint Jack by director Peter Bogdanovich, Ben Gazzara plays an American pimp, operating in Singapore. Seeking independence from the local mob, Gazzara is browbeaten--and sometimes just beaten--by the criminal powers-that-be. Resignedly, Gazzara goes to work for a fellow American mobster (played by director Bogdanovich, who is appropriately slimy) and ordered to photograph a crime-fighting senator (George Lazenby) in a compromising position. Gazzara finally develops a conscience, a shade too late. Filmed on location, Saint Jack was produced by the director's former mentor Roger Corman.
