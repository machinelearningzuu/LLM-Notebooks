Title: 3 days in foodie paradise

Made with a recipe passed down from generations, this stall’s laksa (spicy coconut milk-based noodle soup) is a hot favourite (pun intended) in the neighbourhood, and has won a Michelin Bib Gourmand recommendation. Lovers of all things spicy should certainly try this Peranakan*-inspired rendition of a locally beloved dish.

*The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.
