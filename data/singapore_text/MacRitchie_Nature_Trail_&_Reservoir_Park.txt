Title: MacRitchie Nature Trail & Reservoir Park

Mention MacRitchie to any Singaporean and the talk will certainly turn to cross-country runs, nature trails and the TreeTop Walk.

Anchored by Singapore’s largest reservoir—part of a water catchment system that captures rain water—the park and nature reserve at the very heart of Singapore is a popular destination for runners, water sports enthusiasts, and of course nature lovers.

If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the tranquility of walking above lush green foliage, you’ll get your chance at the Treetop Walks, a 250-metre aerial free standing suspension bridge spanning the two highest points within MacRitchie.

Take an exhilarating walk around the 11-kilometre nature trail loop known as MacRitchie Trails, located within the tropical rainforest of Central Catchment Nature Reserve. You’ll likely bump into long-tailed macaque monkeys, squirrels and monitor lizards. If you’re lucky, you may even encounter colugos (flying lemurs) or owls!

MacRitchie Reservoir was constructed in 1867, through a donation of S$13,000 by philanthropist Tan Kim Seng, and is one of the four reservoirs located within the nature reserve. The others include Lower Peirce Reservoir, Upper Peirce Reservoir and Upper Seletar Reservoir.

With so many attractions and scenic spots of nature on offer, MacRitchie is an excellent destination for anyone who loves fun and the outdoors.
