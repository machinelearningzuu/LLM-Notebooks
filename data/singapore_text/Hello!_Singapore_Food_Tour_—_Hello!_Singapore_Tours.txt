Title: Hello! Singapore Food Tour â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Ask any Singaporean what their favourite past time is and they will say eating. Eat like a local on a private food tour and discover why Singaporeans love their food so much!

Our Singapore food tours last 5.5 hours and cover four districts of Singapore; the East Coast (also known as Katong), Old Airport Road, Kampong Glam and Little India. In each district you will enjoy foods from each of the main ethnic groups of Singapore; Chinese, Peranakan, Malay (Muslim) and Indian. There are 10+ food tastings on this tour.

Please note that there is a wide variety of foods on this tour. If you are unable to consume any of the following then it does mean that you will NOT be able to eat/drink everything on the tour: milk, meat, pork, prawns, fish, wheat/gluten, spice. If you are unable to consume several of those foods then you may prefer to opt for a private customised tour rather than a food tour.

We offer both a public group and private food tours. Public group tours run on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings. Private food tours are available 7 days a week and can start any time before 3 pm.
