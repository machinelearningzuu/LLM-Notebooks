Title: Best Chinese cuisines in Singapore

The earliest records of Chinese influence in Southeast Asia date back a thousand years, but it was not until the 19th and early 20th centuries when the burgeoning opportunities in the port of Singapore drew an influx of migrants from Southern China.

Experience the eclectic cultures of the Cantonese (renowned for delicious dumplings, rich marinades and deep frying), Hainanese (their popular pork chop and chicken rice sport global influences), Hakka (famous for their ‘abacus beads’ and yong tau fu), Hokkien (best known for fried noodles and nutritious soups) and Teochew (known for their rich braised dishes and light, steamed seafood) people through their cuisines, and enjoy how their dishes have adapted to Southeast Asian ingredients and Singaporean palates.

Cantonese cuisine

Cantonese dim sum—which translates to “delights the heart”—consists of bite-sized portions of food served in steamer baskets or small plates. Relish a range of textures and flavours when you dig into dim sum, which ranges from soft chee cheong fun (steamed rice noodle rolls) and meat dumplings like siew mai and har gao, to tau sar pau (sweet red bean buns) and xiao long pau (“little dragon buns”, with tender skin that pop open to release nutritious soup). Locals flock to Swee Choon Tim Sum Restaurant when they crave dumplings after a night out, as this watering hole is open every day except Tuesday till 6am, and also serves an assortment of soft and sweet desserts. TungLok Teahouse and Lei Garden also boast gourmet dim sum experiences. Cantonese favourites like Lanzhou noodles (light noodles served with meat in clear soup), fried beef noodles, century egg porridge, and sweet and sour pork can be enjoyed in the sophisticated settings of various acclaimed restaurants. These include Yàn in the National Gallery Singapore; one-Michelin-starred Lei Garden in CHIJMES; and heartland stalls like Keng Eng Kee. Cantonese dishes are served with a contemporary spin in Mitzo along Orchard Road, where homemade tofu is made with crab meat, crispy duck is topped with truffles, and classic dumplings are finished with caviar. The Cantonese like to fry their comfort foods—like diced beef, fried rice and fried noodles—in an extremely hot cast iron wok, employing a technique called wok hei. This practice smokes and chars food, and translates to the “wok’s breath”, which is left deliciously imprinted on the food.
