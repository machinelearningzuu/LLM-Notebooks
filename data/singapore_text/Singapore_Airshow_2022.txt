Title: Singapore Airshow 2022

Overview

Asia’s biggest aerospace and defence exhibition, Singapore Airshow returned for its eighth edition from 15 to 18 February 2022. Close to 13,000 trade visitors from more than 39 countries/regions and almost 600 participating companies reconnected and explored business opportunities over the four days of the show. “We are thrilled that our exhibitors and visitors came together for conversations, and more importantly to collaborate,” said Leck Chet Lam, Managing Director of Experia Events, organiser of the event.

As Asia’s most influential platform for top decision-makers in the global aerospace and defence ecosystem, Singapore Airshow attracted global aviation companies such as Airbus, Boeing and Lockheed Martin as well as government agencies and armed forces from around the world. Leading firms headquartered in Asia such as ST Engineering and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China were also in attendance, pulling out all stops to highlight the latest innovations.

Optimism for industry recovery was palpable throughout the event, with many also discussing pathways and solutions towards a more sustainable future for the sector.
