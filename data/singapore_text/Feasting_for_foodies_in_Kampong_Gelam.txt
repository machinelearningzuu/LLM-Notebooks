Heritage food

Seek out the heritage-rich restaurants and eateries that locals frequent; some of these boast a history even older than Singapore’s.



Top of the list on must-visit establishments is Zam Zam Singapore, an Indian Muslim restaurant that has been opened since 1908. This family-run business specialises in briyani (an Indian spiced rice dish with meat or vegetables); share the dish or go in hungry to savour the generous portions served.

Other popular picks include murtabak (stuffed pan-fried bread) as well as roti prata (South Indian flatbread), which are popular breakfast-lunch favourites, usually dipped in the accompanying curries.

Further along North Bridge Road is Warong Nasi Pariaman, an eatery with a history that dates back to 1948. It specialises in nasi padang, which is steamed rice served with Indonesian-style dishes like beef rendang (braised meat cooked in coconut milk and spices) and ayam goreng (chicken deep fried in coconut oil).

For rustic kampong (Malay village) dishes, try Hjh Maimunah, a Michelin Bib Gourmand-awarded restaurant and catering group that’s been around since the nineties. Feast on a spread of dishes such as Sundanese grilled chicken and tahu telur (fried tofu, eggs and vegetables topped with prawn paste sauce). Another must-try: the siput sedut (sea snails in coconut milk gravy).

Cafe-hopping fun

The charm of Kampong Gelam lies in its diverse mix of the old and new. Take a stroll through the neighbourhood, and you’ll find traditional shops hawking carpets, perfumes and nonya kebayas (Peranakan*-style blouse and dress) just a stone’s throw away from cool cafés and old-school eats. Coffee connoisseurs will love the selection of quality brews in the area. Head to Earlybird Café for a cup of gingerbread latte to accompany a selection of brunch fare like hotcakes, crumbed eggs on toast or salmon and avocado. Alternatively, drop by I Am, which is just a short walk away. You can’t miss it: a large ‘I am’ sign is placed at its entrance along North Bridge Road. Here, you’ll find western-style mains such as pizzas, charcoal grilled burgers and fish and chips. For hearty eats and sweet treats, drop by Fika Café along Beach Road. This charming eatery is famous for its Swedish-inspired meatballs and baked goods—you’ll want to leave space for a slice of apple crumble pie or salted caramel waffles. *The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.
