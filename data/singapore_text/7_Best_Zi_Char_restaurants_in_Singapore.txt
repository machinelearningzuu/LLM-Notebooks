From iconic seafood dishes like chilli crab to hearty noodles and savoury pork ribs, the choices are endless when it comes to zi char-style dining. Whether you’re looking for a wallet-friendly group dining option or hankering for a local feast, zi char will certainly prove to be up your alley. Here’s a list of establishments we’d recommend.
