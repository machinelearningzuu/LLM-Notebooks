Title: Chinatown — Hello! Singapore Tours

Singapore’s cultural precinct of Chinatown is a hive of activity day and night and a heady mix of old and new. Retail options range from traditional wares to indie boutiques and bespoke finds. Visitors can head to On Cheong Jewellery for gold jewellery that features not only traditional Chinese motifs but also contemporary designs.

Egg tarts and the new contemporary cookie tin series at Tong Heng are the perfect treats for visitors with a sweet tooth. For tea connoisseurs, a visit to one of Singapore’s oldest tea merchants, Pek Sin Choon along Mosque Street is a definite must.
