Title: Chingay Parade 2023

If a single event could capture the essence of Singapore’s unique multicultural personality, it would be the Chingay Parade—an annual marvel of dazzling floats, dancing dragons and stilt walkers.

It may be held during the Chinese New Year festivities, but this wondrous event brings together people and performances from across Singapore’s cultural spectrum, and is celebrated by Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians alike.

With all its noise and gaiety, the parade was mooted over four decades ago as a way to compensate for the ban that had been placed on firecrackers, a customary Chinese New Year practice to drive away evil spirits.

With the theme 'Embrace Tomorrow', the 2023 Chingay showcase will be its 51st edition, with over 10,00 local performers and artists contributing to the celebration.

Set to take place at the F1 Pit Building on 3 and 4 February 2023, this year’s edition will feature local works of art, music and dance performances and the colourful floats that have become an iconic part of the festival.
