Title: Event Industry Resilience Roadmap

The pandemic is changing and reshaping the global Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, Exhibitions (MICE) and events industry.

With the need to reinvent and adapt, the Singapore Association of Convention & Exhibition Organisers & Suppliers (SACEOS) with the support of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) have come together to formulate the Event Industry Resilience Roadmap (IRR).

Health and safety are of paramount importance during this pandemic, and the IRR ensures that enterprises are equipped to deliver safe experiences for everyone.

The IRR will also be constantly updated so enterprises always have the latest information and necessary skills to emerge stronger. To find out more about the IRR, including information around grants, support schemes, SME solutions, learning programs, best practice manuals, and other initiatives, please visit http://www.saceos.org.sg/IRR.
