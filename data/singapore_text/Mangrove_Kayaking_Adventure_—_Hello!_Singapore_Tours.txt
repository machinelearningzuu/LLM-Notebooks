Title: Mangrove Kayaking Adventure — Hello! Singapore Tours

Specially designed for adventure seekers, this 4-hour expedition is perfect for both novice and experienced kayakers. Based on Palau Ubin, a tiny island which is home to Singapore’s last village or kampongs, as well as the Chek Jawa Wetlands, one of Singapore’s richest ecosystems, this trip is perfect for those wishing to experience Singapore’s nature.

Do not be fooled by the peacefulness of Palau Ubin because the mangroves are abuzz with wildlife! For bird-watching enthusiasts, you will be able to spot species such as the Kingfishers, Eagles, Hornbills, Herons, and Egrets – and that is just to name a few.

Come as you are because equipment and gear will be provided.

Start between 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM or 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM (depends on tide schedule).
