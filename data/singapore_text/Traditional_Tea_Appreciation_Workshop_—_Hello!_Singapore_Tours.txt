Title: Traditional Tea Appreciation Workshop â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Choose from a short 20 to 30-minute introduction to Chinese tea and the art of the tea ceremony and a longer 1.5 to 2-hours workshop led by a tea master.

In both cases you will enjoy the Imperial tea that Queen Elizabeth II was served in the very same tea house.

These tea appreciation workshops can be booked as a stand alone activity or incorporated into a day tour based around Chinese culture and heritage.

We recommend booking this traditional workshop together with a second workshop at ETTE, where we put a modern twist on tea with a hands on tea blending session and talk about innovative flavour creation.
