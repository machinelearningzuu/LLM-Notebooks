Title: Singapore Walking Tour — Hello! Singapore Tours

We can combine some of the must see’s like the Singapore River and riding the Singapore Flyer with something a little more off the beaten track to ensure that you see Singapore for what it really is; a melting pot of cultures and flavours. It is a city which has seen unprecedented growth, a city which competes on the global playing field despite its tiny size. It has been beautifully designed with the intention not just to be ‘green’, but to be a City in a Garden. It is a city where efficiency, style, gastronomies and cultures meet like in no other.

If you are a foodie but do not want to do our full food tour we can combine foodie elements into your Customised Private Tour, ensuring that you still get a wonderful mouthwatering taste of Singapore. If you would like to pick up some souvenirs en route we can show you our favourite markets. Perhaps you are a photographer and would like to visit the most photogenic locations. Or an architect with an interest in learning about the city from a town planning perspective. Whatever it is we will ensure that your customized tour is exactly what you are looking for.
