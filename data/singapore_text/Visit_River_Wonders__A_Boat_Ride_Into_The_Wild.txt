Title: Visit River Wonders: A Boat Ride Into The Wild

Nestled between the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, the River Wonders is both a river-themed zoo and aquarium. Singapore's newest wildlife park has over 6,000 animals, including 40 threatened species, with zones that replicate the habitats of rivers across the world, from the Mississippi to the Yangtze.

Panda Paradise

Before visiting resident giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia at the Giant Panda Forest, stop by to look at the River Wonders Singapore’s adorable red panda.

Its rust-coloured fur and fox-like face are just as winsome as the celebrity panda couple, making this exhibit very popular.

Up close and personal

Panda mania aside, there are many more animals at Asia's first and only river-themed wildlife park. Embark on an up-close adventure with pelicans, beavers and capybaras on the safari’s Once Upon A River show.

Wander into Wild Amazonia and set sail on the Amazon River Quest, an easy 10-minute boat ride that lets you meet some of the amazing wildlife from the world’s largest tropical rainforest, such as the jaguar and maned wolf.

Step into the Squirrel Monkey Forest and say ‘hi’ to this tropical aviary’s free-ranging residents. Look out for their bounding leaps from the trees above you.

Then watch in awe as massive manatees swim serenely around their equally gargantuan aquarium at the Amazon Flooded Forest, a truly beautiful sight.
