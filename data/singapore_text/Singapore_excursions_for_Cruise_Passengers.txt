Whichever option you choose we will ensure that you make the most of your limited time.

We can combine some of the must see’s like the Singapore River cruise and Gardens By The Bay with something a little more off the beaten track to ensure that you see Singapore for what it really is; a melting pot of cultures and flavours. It is a city which has seen unprecedented growth, a city which competes on the global playing field despite its tiny size. It has been beautifully designed with the intention not just to be ‘green’, but to be a City in a Garden. It is a city where efficiency, style, gastronomies and cultures meet like no other. Make sure you don’t fill up at your ships buffet, Singapore is a food lovers paradise. How about visiting to one of the worlds cheapest Michelin Star restaurants on your Singapore excursions?
