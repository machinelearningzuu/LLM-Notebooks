Title: Vegetarian dining in eastern Singapore

Going meat-free in Singapore guarantees you a meal every bit as delectable as those meant for non-vegetarians. Ice cream, authentic Peranakan* nosh, and even burgers with all the works are just a few vegan- and vegetarian-friendly dishes you can find in the eastern part of the island. Here are five restaurants worth checking out.

*The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.

Tea Ville Cafe

For comfort food and Western fare



With a completely plant-based menu, Tea Ville Café boasts a diverse menu inspired by a variety of cultures—from Western-style comfort food to Asian fusion dishes.

Some of the most popular items here include the Mac and Cheese Pizza—which features a generous dollop of cheese over a crispy thin crust— and their falafel burger, which brings a middle-eastern spin to an American classic.

If you have a sweet tooth, we suggest saving space for their Belgian Waffles, which come in a variety of flavours like Nutella and banana with caramel.

Tea Ville Cafe. 97 East Coast Road, Singapore 428794. +65 8518 4250.

Mon-Sun noon-10pm.

VeganBurg

For juicy, meatless burgers Founded in 2010, VeganBurg claims to be the world’s first burger joint that uses 100% plant-based and GMO-free patties. Pick from nine burgers, including the delicious Smoky BBQ Burger, which stars a mushroom patty slathered in smoky barbecue sauce and topped with onions, pickles and a slice of tomato. Be sure to try their Creamy Garlic Fries or umami-rich Loaded Shrooms Fries. VeganBurg. 44 Jalan Eunos, Singapore 419502. +65 6844 6868.

Yes Natural Vegetarian Restaurant

For traditional Chinese vegetarian meals

Wholesome Chinese food for both vegetarians and vegans is the order of the day at Yes Natural Vegetarian Restaurant.

The eatery’s signature dish is a plate of fresh veggie noodles served with almond sauce; it’s a delightfully textural treat thanks to the crunchy shredded vegetables. The restaurant also operates a retail and bakery arm, offering vegan options like eggless cakes and red rice loaves laced with red rice grains.

Loving Hut

For reimagined hawker fare

Loving Hut is a vegan restaurant that doles out Peranakan, Asian and Western fare. Go local with a bowl of mee siam (a Malay dish of rice vermicelli that’s served in a sweet and sour gravy) or the oyster-free orh lua, which is a wok-fried omelette that comes with a side of chilli sauce.

Or if you’re feeling particularly hungry, try nasi campur; it’s a simple rice dish that’s served on a banana leaf, and comes with pickled fruit, spicy eggplant, tofu and green vegetables. There’s also Western grub on the menu, including an almond crumb fillet and a pan-fried portobello mushroom with mashed potato.

Loving Hut. 229 Joo Chiat Road #01-01, Singapore 427489. +65 6348 6318.
