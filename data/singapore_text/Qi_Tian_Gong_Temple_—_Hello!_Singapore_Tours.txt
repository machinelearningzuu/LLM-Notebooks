Title: Qi Tian Gong Temple — Hello! Singapore Tours

A neighbourhood fixture since the 1920s, this temple is nicknamed the Monkey God Temple since it is dedicated to the Taoist deity from the Chinese literary classic Journey to the West. More than ten statues of the Monkey God— including one that is almost a century old—can be found within.
