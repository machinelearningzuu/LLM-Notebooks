Singapore’s Only Tall Ship Royal Albatross Launches “Pirates Ahoy” Sunday Adventure for Kids

Royal Albatross is excited to announce the launch of their first kids sailing experience on-board the only Tall Ship in Asia-Pacific, Pirates Ahoy! Every Sunday, starting Sunday 28 May 2023 at 9am.

This unique pirate experience in Singapore will give kids the chance to dress up in their favourite pirate attire and enjoy the pirate life on a real pirate ship, learning all about pirates, Tall Ships and life at sea from the Captain of the Royal Albatross. Kids will also enjoy special pirate games and activities to develop their pirate skills, with the Pirate Crew from The Royal Albatross. Kids can also play together with their families during the two-hour sailing experience.

Kids will learn about the pirate life and some interesting facts about the Royal Albatross. They’ll also get hands-on experience with some fun pirate games and activities, giving them an authentic look into life on board this unique pirate vessel. Pirates Ahoy! is a new adventure that will be led by the experienced Royal Albatross events team. At the end of the tour, each child will receive a special Young Cadet certificate that marks their successful completion of Pirates Ahoy. Parents are encouraged to get involved too, so you can join in the fun while learning something new together with your children.

The Royal Albatross is majestically berthed adjacent to the Sea Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa and has established itself as a unique and premium attraction for local and international visitors to Singapore, as well as a first-class venue to host private and corporate events.
