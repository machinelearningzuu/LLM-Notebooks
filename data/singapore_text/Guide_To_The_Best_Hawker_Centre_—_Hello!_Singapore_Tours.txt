Title: Guide To The Best Hawker Centre — Hello! Singapore Tours

Indicative of Tiong Bahru’s old-meets-new appeal, this establishment was built on the site of the old Seng Poh Road Market and reopened in 2006 as a two-storey market and food centre. The first floor lets visitors experience a typical Singapore wet market before heading upstairs to enjoy delicious local dishes. With over 80 stalls housed in an art deco-style building, the hawker centre houses many famous stalls. These includes Jian Bo Shui Kueh (#02-05), serving traditional handmade chwee kueh (steamed rice cakes topped with preserved radish), and Tiong Bahru Lor Mee (#02-80), which sells lor mee (thick rice noodles in a rich gravy) with generous toppings such as braised pork belly, ngoh hiang (five-spice meat rolls) and fried wanton (Chinese dumplings), all for S$3 per bowl. Dessert stall Tian Tian Yuan Dessert House (#02- 15) has over 80 hot and cold desserts to choose from. Order the S$2 ice kachang (sweet shaved ice with toppings) for a refreshing treat.
