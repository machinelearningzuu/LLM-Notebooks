Title: East Coast Park & Beach in Singapore

If there’s one place in Singapore that’s synonymous with sporty outdoor activities, it’s East Coast Park, where some seven million locals and tourists flock to for the variety of sporting, entertainment and dining attractions.

Along this 15-kilometre stretch of beach, you’ll find hordes of cyclists and roller bladers enjoying the sun and sea breeze, while cable skiing and water sports are on offer for those who prefer offshore and aquatic activities.

The action amps up several notches at the world-class Xtreme SkatePark, a place where adrenaline junkies can get their fix.

It’s a great place to just sit back and relax too, with no shortage of restaurants, bars and cafes along the beaches to sip on a cocktail or grab a bite. Keep it simple and have a picnic with family and friends by the beach under the swaying coconut palms and casuarinas.

Whatever you choose to do, there’s no better way to end the day than with hearty local fare at the East Coast Food Lagoon, where you can feast on local favourites like satay (grilled meat skewers) and barbecued chicken wings right on the beach.
