Title: Affordable Michelin Meals

Besides being the gold standard for world-class meals, many of us tend to associate the word ‘Michelin’ with hefty bills and exclusive dining experiences.

But stellar flavours don’t always come with a steep price tag, particularly in our food paradise of Singapore.

Not only is our city home to the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred meal, it also boasts a plethora of Michelin-starred and Michelin Bib Gourmand-listed restaurants serving up affordable and exquisite dishes.

Here’s our guide to value for money Bib Gourmand establishments and Michelin star restaurants that are perfect for your next gathering with friends or family.

Ka-Soh Restaurant As pioneers of the traditional Cantonese-style fish soup in Singapore, Ka-Soh offers value for money and hearty fare in a relaxed restaurant setting. Your visit would not be complete without trying the signature sliced fish soup with noodles. The rich texture and colour of its milky white broth is achieved through the painstaking process of boiling the snakehead fish and bones over high heat for many hours. Other noteworthy dishes to share include prawn paste chicken and deep fried pork ribs. Alumni Medical Centre. 2 College Road, Singapore 169850. +65 6473 6686.

Muthu’s Curry This well-loved institution in Little India has been dishing out its iconic fish head curry for more than 50 years. Now run by its second-generation owners, the blend of spices used in its curry paste continues to be a closely guarded secret. Featuring a distinctly south Indian menu, the portions at Muthu’s Curry are suitable for sharing and make for a heart-warming meal with your family. Muthu’s Curry. 138 Race Course Road #01-01, Singapore 218591. +65 6392 1722.

Daily 10.30am-10.30pm.

Sik Bao Sin (Desmond’s Creation)

If you’re hankering for a taste of tradition, gather your friends for tze char (a style of dining where local dishes are cooked to order and eaten communally) at Sik Bao Sin.

Helmed by second-generation chef Desmond Chia, the restaurant’s menu comprises just over a dozen Cantonese staples, ranging from steamed pork with salted fish, kailan (Chinese kale) with beef and prawns with tofu.

All the food at this cosy restaurant is painstakingly cooked by chef Desmond himself, and some of the more complex pork dishes may take up to an hour to prepare. Nonetheless, the authentic flavours you’ll experience here make it well worth the wait.

Sik Bao Sin (Desmond's Creation). 592 Geylang Road (between Lorong 34 & 36), Singapore 389531. +65 6744 3757.
