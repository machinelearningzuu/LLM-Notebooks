Title: Mee Pok Man — Hello! Singapore Tours

Based on a short story and script by local writer Damien Sin, the film casts an uncompromising gaze into the marginal losers of society, following a dim-witted mee pok seller who is obsessed with Bunny, a prostitute who frequents his stall. Bunny dreams of a better life and remains unaware of the man’s affections until circumstances lead to a most unlikely union and a resolution that borders on the macabre.
