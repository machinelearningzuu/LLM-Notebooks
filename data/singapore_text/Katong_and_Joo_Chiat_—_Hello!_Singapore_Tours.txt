Title: Katong and Joo Chiat — Hello! Singapore Tours

Visitors will find traditional shophouses alongside chic yoga studios and traditional coffee shops beside hip cafés that crank out cold-brewed coffees in the Katong and Joo Chiat neighborhood. Visit quaint Peranakan (Straits-born people of Chinese and Malay/ Indonesian heritage) boutique Rumah Bebe to pick up exquisite fabrics and embroidered pouches, and then head over to Cat Socrates.

This charming shop, founded by Hellen Jiang, specialises in Singaporean literature and quirky local-inspired Bric- a-Brac—think cushions that resemble tutu kueh (steamed cakes with crushed peanut or grated coconut filling), feline- related merchandise and Singlish (a colloquial form of English) postcards. Take a trip down to MOX, a co-creative working space, for fresh finds by young entrepreneurs.

Visitors to MOX can take home contemporary renditions of traditional clothing from modern batik (traditional Indonesian fabric) fashion brand Baju by Oniatta and modern cheongsam (a body-hugging traditional Chinese dress) brand Studio HHFZ
