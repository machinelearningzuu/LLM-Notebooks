Title: Dancing Girl Sculpture — Hello! Singapore Tours

The district’s first piece of public art is located in Seng Poh Garden. Sculpted by Sarawak-born artist, Lim Nang Sang, who also created the iconic Merlion statue, the concrete 1.2-meter- high ‘Dancing Girl’ sculpture was commissioned to be the centerpiece of the landscaped garden in 1972.
