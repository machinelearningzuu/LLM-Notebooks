One thing Gee Soo likes about working with Hello! Singapore:

At Hello! Singapore, I feel so welcomed and free to express thoughts. Laura is always open to ideas and suggestions. Full of fun and super easy to work with. The admin/support team has been doing amazing stuff behind the scene, they make sure the shows go on as planned, although we never met but there is so much trust in between which I really appreciate. Fellow guides are helpful and always share information, we really work as a team. Hello Singapore - to me (originally from Malaysia), is a family away from family.

Something not many people know about Gee Soo:

I am afraid of ghost. I love horror movies and love ghost stories but I am dead scared of ghosts. Don't scare me!
