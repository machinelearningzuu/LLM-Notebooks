Title: Michelin Star Winners 2022

The results of the 2022 Singapore Michelin Star list are in, with an impressive tally of 52 restaurants lauded for their culinary excellence.



Arguably the most famous culinary accolade in the world, the Michelin Star list celebrates top dining establishments around the globe, with each star denoting grades of excellence.



Restaurants are rated based on five criteria: quality of ingredients used, mastery of cooking technique and flavours, projection of the chef’s personality in his or her cuisine, value for money, as well as consistency over time and across the entire menu.



The trio of fine-dining restaurants that topped the list in 2021 — namely Les Amis, Odette and Zén — continue their hot streak by retaining their three-Michelin-star rankings, while Cloudstreet and Thevar are brand new entries in the two-Michelin star category.



Seven new restaurants have also been awarded a Michelin Star this year, with four of them having won this accolade for the very first time.



There’s a flavour to suit every palate in Singapore, so dig into our guide to this year’s winners.
