Title: Gamescom Asia 2021

Overview

2021 marked the debut of the highly anticipated Asian edition of gamescom – one of Europe’s leading trade fairs for video games. Based in Singapore, gamescom asia is a platform for both Southeast Asian game developers to explore global partnerships, as well as for international publishers looking to connect with Asia’s gaming industry.

Held from 14 to 17 October 2021 at the Suntec Convention Centre, the hybrid event attracted more than 2,200 physical and virtual attendees from 60 countries. The event, which was organised by Koelnmesse Singapore and supported by game – the association of the German games industry, consisted of several key segments. These included the industry conference and virtual Trade Zone (14-15 Oct), both of which were targeted at B2B audiences, as well as a B2C-oriented fully online Entertainment Zone (15-17 Oct).

Among the many exciting events on offer over the four days were panels, keynotes and technical dialogues by industry experts from renowned studios such as Riot Games, Bandai Namco and Neon Doctrine, as well as hands-on test drives of the latest game and product demos. Avid gamers tuning in virtually were not left out as they were kept entertained by live hosts, sneak peeks, game trailers, online challenges and interviews.

Further adding to the bustle of gamescom asia were two partner events: Gaming Matters – a trade conference that explores the synergies between the gaming industry and the music, sports and marketing industries, and Global Top Round (GTR) Conference – which supports early-stage gaming studios around the world. The latter event was attended by investors, publishers and partners, as well as the Top 20 finalists of GTR’s annual acceleration programme.
