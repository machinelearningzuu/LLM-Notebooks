Title: Singapore Airlines

If you’d like to begin your vacation the moment you step on board the plane, you should consider flying Singapore Airlines.

First formed in 1972, Singapore’s flag carrier airline is best known for its multiple travel accolades and impeccable service standards, embodied in its kebaya (traditional nonya dress)-clad flight attendants (famously known as the Singapore Girl).

Stellar service is just one of a host of reasons that makes Singapore Airlines a world-class travel brand. The airline is also famous for luxurious flight experiences across cabin classes, with state-of-the-art entertainment options, spacious cabins and a commitment to making flying a personal experience. The airlines’ international culinary panel—which comprises eight chefs from all around the globe—are constantly whipping up new dishes to delight the taste buds of passengers onboard.

Singapore Airlines’ globally acclaimed standards have won the organisation multiple awards, ranging from a place on Fortune Magazine’s list of Top 50 Most Admired Companies in 2021 to being awarded the Highest Diamond Rating in the APEX Health Safety powered by SimpliFlying audit of global airlines.

Together with its budget carrier arm, Scoot, Singapore Airlines operates a fleet of more than 180 aircrafts, with a combined passenger network that spans more than 110 destinations. Which means that no matter where you are across the globe, you’re never far from the Lion City.
