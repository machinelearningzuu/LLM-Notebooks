Title: Mr Stork — Hello! Singapore Tours

Nestled at the top of hotel Andaz Singapore on Level 39, Mr. Stork is a destination rooftop bar providing 360-degree views of the city. Inspired by how storks build large nests atop trees and buildings, the bar houses ten teepee huts set amid lush, locally- inspired tropical landscaping and cobbled paving—providing a cosy and unique seating. Its garden-inspired menu consists of various fruity and floral cocktails created using garden herbs and fresh fruits such as ginger, thyme, basil, mint, rhubarb and lemon.

Highlights include Rhubarb (S$22++), a fizzy and refreshing concoction of fresh rhubarb puree, strawberry and lemon juice, sparkling wine and a shot of vodka; and Ruby (S$22++), a citrusy drink concocted with lemon, ginger, fresh mint, vermouth and Ceylon Arrack, a traditional Sri Lankan spirit, served in an adorable elephant mug. Mr Stork is also the only establishment at Andaz Singapore that serves Andaz Pale Ale on tap, a special collaboration with local microbrewery RedDot® Brewhouse that is exclusive to Andaz Singapore.
