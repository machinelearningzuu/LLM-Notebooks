If criss-crossing balance beams suspended in mid-air sounds like your idea of fun, you’ve come to the right place.

Singapore is home to plenty of obstacle courses that will push your mind and body to the limit and beyond. We’re talking about being a bona fide Ninja Warrior, careening through the skies at 60km/h and swinging on ropes like Tarzan. You’ll find all these and more in this list of obstacle courses in town.

X-Park at BOUNCE Singapore

Think you’ve got what it takes to complete the American Ninja Warrior circuit? Then battle your way through X-Park, Asia’s first Ninja Warrior-like adventure course. You’ll find this obstacle course at BOUNCE Singapore, an indoor trampoline park located at Cineleisure Orchard. Your goal: to complete obstacles in the fastest and most creative way possible. You will be bouncing on trampolines, scaling bouldering walls, balancing on beams and zipping down an aerial runway. It’s the ultimate test of your agility, strength and force of will—you’ve been warned. Cathay Cineleisure Orchard. 8 Grange Road #09-01, Singapore 239695. +65 6816 2879.

Forest Adventure

Shuffle across suspension bridges, climb rope ladders, and yell like Tarzan as you swing on trapezes—all while dangling in harnesses amid the lush canopies of Bedok Reservoir Park. Forest Adventure is Singapore’s first treetop obstacle course, which features 69 crossings and six ziplines across three age-appropriate categories. Let your grit and determination guide you through the 44 obstacles of the Grand Course, and careen over the waters on three ziplines for a two-and-a-half-hour challenge. If you’re visiting with teenagers, they’ll be able to push the limits of their confidence on the Junior Course, which boasts 26 obstacles and takes approximately an hour and fifteen minutes to complete. The young ’uns won’t feel left out here, either. Forest Adventure has a course designed for children at least 1.1 metres tall. Whip out your cameras and snap away as your brave kids tackle balancing beams, spider nets and zip lines at the Kids Course.
