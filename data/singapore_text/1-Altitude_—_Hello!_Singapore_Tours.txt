Title: 1-Altitude — Hello! Singapore Tours

Perched 282 meters above ground, 1-Altitude Gallery & Bar is the world’s highest alfresco rooftop bar and club. With 360-degree views of Singapore, visitors can enjoy a cocktail in hand during 1-Altitude’s Sundown Affair (6–9 pm) and relax to laidback DJ-spun beats, while admiring the stunning city skyline. At night, the atmosphere livens up with top hits and high-energy rave beats by 1-Altitude’s resident party band and DJs.
