Title: ETTE Modern Tea Blending Workshop — Hello! Singapore Tours

Explore the art of tea blending in this 30-minute modern tea workshop.

Tea blending or scenting is defined as the process of putting different teas together to produce a final product. This activity aims to create a well-balanced flavour using teas of different origins and characters. Combining the heritage and tradition of tea with a modern and classic design.

In this workshop you will become a “Tea Chemist” for the day! Each participant will take home their creation.

This workshop can be booked as a stand-alone activity or incorporated into one of our tours. We recommend booking this together with the Traditional Tea Appreciation class to cover both the traditional and modern aspects of tea culture.
