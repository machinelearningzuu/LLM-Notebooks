Whether you’re soaring high over the jungle canopies of an island resort, taking a joyride in a sportscar or pushing the limits of your courage on movie-themed rollercoaster rides, the Lion City is filled with adrenaline-pumping activities for thrill chasers.

Here’s a small sample of the daredevil shenanigans that action seekers can get up to in Singapore.

Picture this—bustling city traffic, the shimmering Singapore River, and you hurtling through the air at 160 kilometres per hour. Do just that on the Slingshot, a ride that seats up to five and which will catapult you nearly 70 metres up towards the sky. Parents hoping to experience this thrilling ride with the entire family should note that there’s a height requirement of 120 centimetres, with a minimum age requirement of 12 years old and above. Slingshot. 3E River Valley Road, Clarke Quay, Singapore 179024. +65 6338 1766.

Daily 4.30-11.30pm.

Experience skydiving in a different way at iFly Singapore—a free-fall simulation that’s home to indoor skydiving world champ and World’s Fastest Flyer Kyra Poh. Each flyer gets two skydives in the iFly wind tunnel, and the time taken for each dive is the same as falling through the air from 12,000 feet. iFly Singapore. 43 Siloso Beach Walk #01-01, Singapore 099010. +65 6571 0000.

For adrenaline-pumping thrill rides with a bit of movie magic, head to Universal Studios Singapore. Scream your lungs out on the 3D simulator thrill ride TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle, river raft ride Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure™, or the high-speed outdoor roller coaster Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN vs. CYLON™. The latter allows you to either ride on the ‘human’ track, or up the ante and go full ‘Cylon’ on a track that features alternate loops and turns.

Conquer your fear of heights—the Mega Adventure Park - Singapore at Sentosa is all zip-lines and high-element activities. The park’s main attraction is the Mega Zip, a 450-metre zip-line which takes you from the peak of Imbiah Hill to a man-made island off Siloso Beach. Zip across jungle canopies, pristine sands and crystal-clear waters along the way. Alternatively, take things to another level by challenging yourself on the ClimbMax, an obstacle course of aerial ropes, ladders, and flying foxes or, defy gravity at MegaBounce, a trampoline that features elastic ‘powercords’ which will have you jumping up to ten metres in the air.
