Dave and Susan experienced being a local for a day by using Singapores’ world class transportation. They started their day taking the train to their first stop which is the Raffles Place, one of the most iconic and oldest buildings in the civic district. They enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the Market Street Hawker Center where they tried the famous kaya toast and poached egg best paired with a black Hainanese coffee.

They went to Capita Spring Building and took an elevator up to the 51st floor where they explored the edible plants gardens. Blessed with a great weather, they were able to admire from afar the Johor Bahru of Malaysia and the islands of the Riau Archipelago.

Susan and Dave explored the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and walked the alleyways of Chinatown, taking in the sights, the sounds and the smells especially from the Durians, which is in no doubt an unforgettbale moment
