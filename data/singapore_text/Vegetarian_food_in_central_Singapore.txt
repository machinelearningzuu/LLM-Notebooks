Title: Vegetarian food in central Singapore

There’s good reason why Singapore ranks as Asia’s second most vegan-friendly city according to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). The island is home to an array of vegan and vegetarian options that go beyond bowls of salad. We’ve got seafood-free sushi and sashimi, spicy vegetable curries and even a meatless Peranakan*-Thai restaurant that caught the eye of Michelin inspectors. Here are five vegetarian places to check out in central Singapore.

*The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.

Afterglow by ANGLOW

For farm-to-table dining

Join the raw food movement when you dine at Afterglow by ANGLOW. This restaurant works closely with local and regional farms to obtain fresh produce for its vibrant vegan dishes. Try the drag-pom salad, which packs an assortment of fruits and vegetables like dragonfruit, avocado and jicama, and their Cuban burger, whose grilled black bean patty is complemented by salsa dressing, flax seed and guacamole. For something hefty, go for the raw lasagna; it’s layered with zucchini, cherry tomato sauce, baby spinach and shiitake mushrooms, and bound together by a ‘cream cheese’ made from cashew nuts.

Afterglow by ANGLOW. 24 Keong Saik Road, Singapore 089131. +65 6224 8921.

Mon-Sat noon-10.30pm.

Joie Restaurant by DOZO

For modern vegetarian cuisine

Take in panoramic views of Orchard Road when you hike up to Joie (pronounced “joy”) Restaurant by DOZO. Located at the rooftop garden of Orchard Central, this meatless fusion restaurant offers fixed set menus for lunch and dinner. Each dish is artfully plated; expect to see zucchini towers stuffed with cream cheese on a puff pastry base, as well as vegetable sashimi with quail egg shooters served on a bed of ice.

Orchard Central. 181 Orchard Road #12-01, Singapore 238896. +65 6838 6966.

Daily noon-3.30pm, 6-10.30pm.

Herbivore

For vegan sushi and sashimi Herbivore stands out from the sea of vegetarian restaurants found at Fortune Centre with its unique menu made up of Japanese and Western dishes. Tuck into the protein-rich natto soba, which are buckwheat noodles mixed with fermented soya beans, or the unagi maki, which puts a spin on the traditional Japanese grilled eel rice rolls by using tofu-based ‘eel’. On the Western side of the menu, pastas like carbonara with mock teriyaki fish make Herbivore one of the more versatile vegetarian joints in town. Fortune Centre. 190 Middle Road #01-13/14, Singapore 188979. +65 6333 1612.

Mon-Fri 11.30am-3pm, 5-9.30pm; Sat & Sun 11.30am-9.30pm.

Annalakshmi

For pay-as-you-wish Indian food Annalakshmi is more than just a vegetarian restaurant—it is a social movement. Run by the Temple of Fine Arts (TFA), a non-profit arts institution, the Indian restaurant prepares an assortment of curries, stews and breads that are as hearty as they are humble. There is no bill at the end of your meal; all you have to do in return is to donate what you think is a fair amount. Proceeds from your donation will be funnelled to the TFA’s programme of workshops, performances and exhibitions of classical Indian arts. Annalakshmi at Amoy. 104 Amoy Street, Singapore 069924. +65 6223 0809.

Mon-Sat 11am-3pm. Annalakshmi at Central Square. 20 Havelock Road #01-04, Singapore 059765. +65 6339 9993.
