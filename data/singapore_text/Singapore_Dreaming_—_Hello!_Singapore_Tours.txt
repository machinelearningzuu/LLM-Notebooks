Title: Singapore Dreaming â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Directors Woo Yen Yen and Colin Goh co-helm the ironic drama Singapore Dreaming (AKA Mei Man Ren Sheng). Richard Low stars as lawyer's clerk Loh Poh Huat, who, despite battling dire poverty himself, is forced to repossess goods from consumers who haven't paid off their credit card debts. Fate shifts when Poh Huat wins two million in the local lottery, so his family expects circumstances to ease significantly for them, but then an unforeseen catastrophe pulls the entire clan into a life-or-death struggle. Alice Lim, Dick Su and Yeo Yann Yann co-star. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi
