Title: The Southern Ridges

For those who want to get away from—and above—the city and a little closer to nature, the Southern Ridges is a great place to explore. As a bonus, you will also get one of the best panoramic views of the city, harbour and the Southern Islands.

The Southern Ridges is a ten-kilometre stretch of green open spaces spanning the hills of some of Singapore’s most popular parks and gardens, connected by picturesque ridges and pathways.

Imagine walking across a bridge 36-metres above the road connecting two hilltops. You can perform this exhilarating high-wire act at Henderson Waves, a distinctive wave-like structure consisting of a series of undulating curved 'ribs', also Singapore’s highest pedestrian bridge.

The Southern Ridges is made up of Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, HortPark, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Reserve.

Bird-watching enthusiasts will be able to catch their favourite creatures in their natural habitat along these trails, while photographers will never run out of picture opportunities of the beautiful flora and fauna found here.
