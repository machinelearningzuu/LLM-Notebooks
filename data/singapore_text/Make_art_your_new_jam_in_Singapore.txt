Title: Make art your new jam in Singapore

You don’t need to be an art aficionado to be creative: art jamming—a social painting experience—has grown in popularity in recent years. The appeal stems from a judgment-free environment where you can create masterpieces to your heart’s content.

Bond with friends and family, and take home a canvas that you can display in your living room—here are some places to wield your paintbrush.

Liberty Art Jam at Artify Studio

At Artify Studio, both the young and young-at-heart can get gloriously messy with paint during the parent-child jamming sessions. But if you want to take your kid’s art skills up a notch, there are friendly instructors on hand to give guidance or tutoring classes for those aged four to six. Likewise, adults can level up through floral painting, watercolour painting, or brush calligraphy to create Instagram-worthy prints. The studio offers a range of workshops centred on a variety of themes and mediums, from calligraphy and watercolour sessions to acrylic painting lessons.
