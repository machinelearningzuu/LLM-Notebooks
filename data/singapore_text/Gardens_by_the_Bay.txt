Title: Gardens by the Bay

It’s hard to miss the sprawling 101-hectare lot right by the water in Marina Bay. Two huge futuristic structures rise out of the greenery at Gardens by the Bay, which was designed with environmental sustainability in mind.

These are the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest cooled conservatories, which was listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records as the world’s largest glass greenhouse. The freestanding unsupported glass roofs enclose expansive spaces, unmarred by any pillar or column.

Besides ultra-modern design, the conservatories also use cutting-edge technologies for better energy efficiency.



Cool domes

The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of regions like California and South Africa, and boasts more than 32,000 plants comprising some 160 species, cultivars and varieties.

Not to be missed is the cool, misty Cloud Forest Dome, with its 35-metre tall “Cloud Mountain”, covered in orchids, ferns and bromeliads and containing a spectacular 30-metre-tall indoor waterfall.

Splendid Supertrees

You’ll recognise the distinctive Supertrees—25 to 50-metre-tall vertical gardens that collect rainwater, generate solar power and act as venting ducts for the park’s conservatories.

If you’re in the mood for a spectacular view, take the OCBC Skyway, a 128-metre-long walkway suspended between two Supertrees, for a bird’s eye view of the park. The Supertree Observatory—located atop the tallest of the 18 Supertrees—boasts a spectacular vista of Marina Bay from 50 metres up in the air.

As dusk falls, the Garden Rhapsody comes on. This dazzling light and sound show takes place nightly amid the Supertrees. Then dine at romantic Marguerite in the Flower Dome, or Satay by the Bay for hearty local food.
