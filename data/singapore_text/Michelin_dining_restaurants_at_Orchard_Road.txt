Japanese

béni

Cuisine: Japanese Fusion

Michelin stars: 1 With its cosy ambience, open kitchen and intimate 15-seat space, béni is the perfect place to get an up close and personal experience with Japanese fusion cuisine. Aptly, the word “béni” means “blessings” in French and “red” in Japanese, a nod to the chef-owner’s love for both styles of cuisine. Chef Kenji Yamanaka’s love for French fare is exemplified in the Japanese reinterpretation of Gallic classics served here. Only tasting menus are available at béni, and we recommend you go for those that feature Ozaki wagyu beef, which is hand-picked by head chef Yamanaka. Mandarin Gallery. 333A Orchard Road #02-37, Singapore 238897. +65 9159 3177.

Mon-Sat noon-3pm, 7-10.30pm.
