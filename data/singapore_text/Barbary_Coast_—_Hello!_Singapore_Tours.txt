Title: Barbary Coast — Hello! Singapore Tours

On the corner of North Canal and Lor Telok, a historic building dating back to the early 1800s has been transformed by dual-concept Barbary Coast. Occupying the lower level, Deadfall reminisces the style of bars that peppered the original Barbary Coast in San Francisco and features creatively crafted cocktails that are affordable.

The upper level of Barbary Coast is a contrast to Deadfall—named The Ballroom, its offerings are highbrow and elegant. Guests to The Ballroom should adhere to its ‘no slippers’ dress code. As a space with varied options across both levels, the bar caters to visitors of different caliber and is inviting to all.
