Title: Kampong Glam — Hello! Singapore Tours

The historic Arab Street which lies between Victoria Street and Beach Road in Singapore’s Kampong Glam district is known for its well-preserved shophouses selling all manner of textiles and carpets. Local dressmakers still come here to pick up lace, silks and batik (traditional Indonesian fabric) sold by the yard or metre from shops like Molkan Fabrics and Collezione La Prima.
