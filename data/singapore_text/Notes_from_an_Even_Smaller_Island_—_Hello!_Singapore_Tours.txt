Summary:

Knowing nothing of Singapore, Neil Humphreys arrives in the land of 'air-conned' shopping centres and Lee Kuan Yew. From the aunties in the hawker centres to expats dressed as bananas, from Singlish to kiasuism, and from Singaporeans abroad, Humphreys explores all aspects of Singaporean life, taking in the sights, dissecting the culture and illuminating each place and person with this perceptive and witty observations. Written by someone who is at once both insider and outside, the book is a wonderfully funny and disarmingly honest portrait of Singapore and its people.
