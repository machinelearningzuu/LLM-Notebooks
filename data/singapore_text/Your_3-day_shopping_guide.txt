Title: Your 3-day shopping guide

Orchard Road isn’t just well known amongst locals—travellers far and wide are familiar with one of the world’s most famous shopping districts. You’ll find fascinating modern structures like ION Orchard, which houses some of your favourite luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Patek Philippe, Saint Laurent, and Tiffany & Co.

There’s also Singapore’s oldest departmental store, TANGS, which stocks plenty of local labels like Aijek (a clothing line featuring effortless pieces made from sustainable fabrics) and a range of international perfume labels like Chloé here. If you’re looking to shop local, drop by Design Orchard, home to the wares of over 60 homegrown designers and craftsmen.
