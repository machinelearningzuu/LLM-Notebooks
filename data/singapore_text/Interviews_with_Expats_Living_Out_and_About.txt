Living Out and About is an exclusive interview series for Nina Out and About where I speak with expats, retirees, digital nomads, and basically anyone living or who has lived abroad. We also speak to some locals to get the scoop on popular or undiscovered expat locations.

I started this series to introduce y’all to more people living around the world in different ways, to help you find the right location and type of expat experience for you.

I’ve lived in over a dozen countries now around the world, on every continent but South America and Antarctica. And I LOVE to talk about my experiences and learn about other people’s. Enjoy!
