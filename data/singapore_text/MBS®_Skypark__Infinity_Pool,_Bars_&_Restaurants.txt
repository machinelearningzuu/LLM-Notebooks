Title: MBS® Skypark: Infinity Pool, Bars & Restaurants

It looks like a celestial surfboard or a spaceship docking on a tripod. No matter where your imagination takes you, the Marina Bay Sands® SkyPark is a wondrous feat of engineering.

Designed by visionary architect Moshe Safdie, the SkyPark floats atop the three soaring Marina Bay Sands® hotel towers.

Giant observation deck

This gravity-defying platform is one of the largest in the world. The 1.2-hectare SkyPark stretches longer than the Eiffel Tower laid down and is large enough to park four and a half A380 Jumbo Jets.

It houses a ticketed observation deck, lush gardens, top-notch restaurants and an exclusive, infinity-edge swimming pool with a legendary view.

The 150-metre pool, the world’s largest elevated body of water outdoors, has been designed with a vanishing edge. It is as if there is nothing between the swimmer and the skyscrapers in front of them.

Those taking a dip feel like they are swimming among the clouds, perched so high in the sky with the most majestic scenery at their feet. However, only hotel guests can swim in the pool and enter the SkyPark free of charge.

Magnificent views

Visitors not staying at the hotel can buy tickets to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, which offers you unobstructed 360-degree views of the Singapore skyline.

Dine at LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar or savour a cocktail at CÉ LA VI—located atop the Sands SkyPark—and witness an unforgettable panoramic view of the Singapore skyline.

After experiencing the slice of heaven that is the SkyPark, descend to earth where a world of shopping, dining and entertainment attractions awaits you at the rest of the Marina Bay Sands® integrated resort.
