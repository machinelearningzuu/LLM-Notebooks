Title: Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall Singapore

The Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall is a must-see for anyone curious about Dr Sun Yat Sen and his contributions to Singapore in the early 20th century.

Honouring a hero

Set in a two-storey colonial villa, the museum honours Dr Sun, who was the leader of the revolutionary movement that overthrew the Qing dynasty, and a pivotal figure in Chinese and Southeast Asian history.

Housed in the same stronghold of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, where the Tong Meng Hui Singapore Branch was found, the museum zeroes in on Dr Sunâ€™s work and impact on Chinese communities in the region during the revolutionary movement.

The alliance, known as Tong Meng Hui, was influential throughout Southeast Asia and paved the way for the end of the Qing dynastic rule.

Close friendships

Take your time to explore the five galleries with multimedia displays. Old photos, personal items and letters from prominent community leaders provide insights into their relationships with Dr Sun.

Other galleries showcase a hologram that recreates scenes of Dr Sun's daily routine and work in the villa. They also examine the impact of the revolution and the rise of Chinese schools, literature, print media and economic activities.

The free daily guided tours are a good option. After visiting the museum, stroll in the pretty gardens of Zhongshan Park, or wander through the Balestier precinct and sample its excellent local hawker fare and restaurants.
