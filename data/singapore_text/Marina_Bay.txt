Title: Marina Bay

A visit to Marina Bay is guaranteed to bombard your senses. With land reclamation works starting only in the 1970s, the transformation of the area has been nothing short of a miracle.

Architectural masterpieces

Marvel at the collection of architectural icons that dot the impressive skyline, or brag about having seen some of the best views in the world from Sands SkyPark® at Marina Bay Sands®, designed by no less than the renowned architect Moshe Safdie.

Want a nature fix? Pop over to the 101-hectare Gardens by the Bay. Revel in the spectacular views from the Supertree Grove amid lush gardens. Escape from the tropical heat at the cooled conservatories or let the kids splash about at the Children’s Garden Water Play area.

Dizzy by the sights of a nautical vision in the distance? That’s just the Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore designed to receive the newer generation of larger cruise liners.

New city living

Expect to see power suits and briefcases while joggers pound the pavement and cyclists whiz by alfresco cafes. You are as likely to find people who come here to work as people who call Marina Bay their home.

If you’re feeling cowed by the skyscrapers, walk along the scenic waterfront promenade decorated with artistic sculptures that lead you right to the water’s edge of Marina Reservoir, where you’ll probably come across kite flyers, dragon boat races, even musical performances.

And this is all just another ordinary day at Marina Bay.
