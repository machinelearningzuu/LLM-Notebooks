Title: That's the way I like it (Forever Fever) â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Glen Goei made his directorial debut with this Singaporean musical comedy in Singlish and Hokkien dialogue. In 1977, laidback Hock (Adrian Pang), always on the brink of getting fired from his supermarket job, hopes to buy a Triumph motorcycle. He lives with his parents, sister Mui (Pam Oci), and brother (Caleb Goh). After seeing a movie titled Forever Fever with a John Travolta look-alike (Dominic Tace), Hock gets inspired. To raise money for the Triumph, Hock takes dance lessons in order to enter a disco competition with a cash prize. Mei (Medaline Tan), who secretly loves Hock, goes with him to his lessons. Hock falls hard for another dance entrant, Julie (Anna Belle Francis), which does not please her boyfriend, Richard (Pierre Png). Some anachronisms are evident in the use of modern Singapore for period location scenes
