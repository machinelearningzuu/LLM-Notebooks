Title: Learn To Eat Like A Local â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

WHEN/TIME: Small group food tours run on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Food tours last 6 hours and start at 9 am.

STARTING POINT: Near the first food stop which is in the East Coast/Katong district of Singapore. Directions, maps and pictures for the meeting point are sent upon booking.

END POINT: Little India (instructions on how to get back to your hotel or to your next activity will be provided by your guide).

DIETARY REQUIREMENTS: There is a wide variety of foods and ingredients in this tour. If you are unable to consume any of the following then it does mean that you will NOT be able to eat/drink everything on the tour: milk, meat, pork, prawns, fish, wheat/gluten, spice. If you are unable to consume several of those foods then you may prefer to opt for a customised tour rather than a food tour. We have taken people on the tour who have not been able to eat many of the foods and they have still enjoyed the tour as there is a lot of cultural and historical information but we would suggest that a non-food tour would be a better option.

BAD WEATHER POLICY: All tours take place come rain or shine and we always have a great day no matter what the weather. We strongly advise you to bring an umbrella as it does rain most days in Singapore!

CANCELLATION POLICY: A 100% refund, (excluding the booking processing charges) will be given if you cancel more than 7 days (more than 168 hours) before your tour.
