Title: Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay — Hello! Singapore Tours

Nicknamed ‘The Durian’ for its spiky, glass-covered construction that resembles the king of fruits, this is the hub of Singapore’s art scene, playing host to music, theatre, dance and art festivals. There are free events every day, from dance performances and outdoor concerts to kid-centric interactive activities, plus quirky shops and restaurants. The adjacent open-air hawker centre, Makansutra Gluttons Bay, offers some of the city’s most-loved food.
