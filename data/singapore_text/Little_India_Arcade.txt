Title: Little India Arcade

At its two-story building dating back to the 1920s, shoppers will find handicrafts, costume jewelry, souvenirs, Indian clothing, silks and so much more. If visitors get hungry while shopping, they can head over to the sweet shops along the area to sample a selection of Indian sweets and pastries. Travelers can also opt to get a henna tattoo done in one of the many shops within the building.
