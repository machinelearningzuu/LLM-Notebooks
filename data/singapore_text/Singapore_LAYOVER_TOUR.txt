Title: Singapore LAYOVER TOUR

We suggest starting your tour from the airport arrivals one hour after flight arrival time. This allows for enough time for you to get off the plane and pass through immigration. If you would like some extra time to freshen up after landing add an extra 30 mins on.

If you book our walking tour you will taxi back to the airport solo (your guide will organise the taxi for you). We suggest finishing your Singapore stopover tour 1.5 to 2 hours before the onward flight. This allows enough time for getting back to the Airport (30 minutes by taxi) and getting back through security to your gate. Most flights start boarding 30 minutes before take off.

The above timings are generous if you are already checked in for your onward flight and do not have to collect luggage and check in again. If you are taking the Private Car Tour option we will drop you back off at the airport. We suggest finishing your tour at the airport drop off 1 hour to 1.5 hours before your onward flight. If you have luggage you can use the left luggage facilities at Changi Airport or if you are taking the Car Tour option you can bring it with you.
