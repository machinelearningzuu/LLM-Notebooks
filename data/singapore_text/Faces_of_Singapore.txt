Title: Faces of Singapore

Chinese

The Chinese are the largest ethnic group in Singapore, making up almost three-quarters of the country’s population. It’s no surprise then that Chinese culture—from the language and food to entertainment and festivals—features prominently in Singapore.

Most of Singapore’s Chinese population made the trek here from the southern provinces of China, including Fujian and Guangdong. Those from the Hokkien and Teochew dialect groups are the most populous, followed by members of the Cantonese, Hainanese and other smaller groups.

Many of these pioneers worked as coolies, responsible for setting the foundation for the Lion City’s future prosperity. Others showed a flair for making money, and many of the city’s notable entrepreneurs were of Chinese descent. Today, Singaporean Chinese are well represented across different segments of society–from politics and business to sports and entertainment circles.

While their traditional culture has since been blended with other local ethnicities and Western influences, the festival of Chinese New Year is still celebrated with much gusto—a raucous reminder of what it means to be Chinese.
