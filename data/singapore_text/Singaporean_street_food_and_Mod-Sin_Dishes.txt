Title: Singaporean street food and Mod-Sin Dishes

Singapore’s food culture is a delectable tapestry of multiculturalism. It was first epitomized in our hawker fare and traditional dishes, but this vibrant food culture is constantly evolving, thanks in no small part to Mod-Sin Cuisine.

Originally coined in 2005, “Mod-Sin” stands for “modern Singaporean cuisine”, and centres on transforming local dishes in delightfully surprising ways.

From heartland hawker stores to Michelin-awarded restaurants, this guide will take you on a journey to experience the best of both worlds. We suggest tantalizing your taste-buds with the original dishes, before expanding your culinary horizons with the modern versions.

AYAM BUAH KELUAK

A mainstay of Nonya* food culture, ayam buah keluak (braised chicken in a spicy tamarind gravy) was brought to Singapore by Peranakans from Java and Sumatra. The buah keluak (black nut indigenous to Southeast Asia) is what gives this dish its colour. A lot of preparation is needed to make this dish—the black nuts have to be boiled, fermented and soaked in water over several days to make it edible. You can learn more about the culture’s rigorous culinary tradition at Guan Hoe Soon in Katong-Joo Chiat. This restaurant serves up a no-frills, classic ayam buah keluak in a piquant, aromatic sauce. For a Western twist on this traditional dish, make Baba Chews your next pitstop. Peranakan food is famous for its rich, complex flavours—drawing from a mix of Chinese, Malaysian and Indonesian cuisine—and the menu here adds Western influences to this heady mix. Their ayam buah keluak is served as a burger, combining a grilled chicken patty, pureed buah keluak and achar (Asian pickles). *Nonya cuisine is also known as Peranakan (meaning "local born") cuisine. The cuisine comes from people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage. Guan Hoe Soon. 38/40 Joo Chiat Place, Singapore 427764. +65 6344 2761.

HAINANESE CHICKEN RICE

One of Singapore’s most famous dishes, chicken rice’s simple ingredients belie its delicious flavours. This local favourite comprises fragrant rice, piquant chilli and ginger paste served with strips of poached or roasted chicken. We recommend Tian Tian Chicken Rice hawker stall at Maxwell Food Centre for its aromatic rice and tender chicken. After this taste of tradition, visit Michelin-starred Labyrinth for Chef-owner LG Han's traditional dishes infused with whimsical, modern twists. The chef’s “Ang Moh” (“Caucasian” in Chinese dialect) Chicken Rice is made with locally-sourced mushrooms and poultry in a roux sauce, and served in a claypot. It was created by his grandmother to suit the palates of her British employers, whom she served as a cook. For other variations on local classics, be sure to the sample the Labyrinth Rojak— 10 edible garden herbs, flowers and sprouts, and stingless bee honey take the place of this traditional fruit salad’s regular ingredients like dough fritters and bean sprouts.

WANTON MEE

Originally brought to Singapore by migrants of Cantonese descent, Wanton Mee consists of egg noodles served with slices of char siew (barbecued pork) and bite-sized wanton (dumplings). Many variations of this hawker dish can be found across the island, but Old Airport Road Food Centre is home to two of the most famous stalls—Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wanton Mee and Cho Kee Noodle. To discover how Singaporean cuisine incorporates global influences, you’ll want to drop by Amoy Street Food Centre, home to the Michelin Bib-Gourmand-awarded A Noodle Story.
