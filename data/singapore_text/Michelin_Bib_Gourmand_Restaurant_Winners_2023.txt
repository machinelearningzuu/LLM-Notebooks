Chai Chuan Tou Yang Rou Tang (Bukit Merah View Food Centre) Chai Chuan Tou Yang Rou Tang has been serving up rich, Teochew-style mutton soup from Bukit Merah View Hawker Centre for over three decades.

Hong Kong Yummy Soup (Alexandra Village Food Centre)

If you’re looking for a healthier dining option, Hong Kong Yummy Soup is definitely the place to be—they serve up six different, MSG-free varieties of soup.

Tiong Bahru

Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee

With signature Hokkien mee (fried prawn noodles) cooked to order in small batches and fried up in a wok to retain its traditional, slightly charred flavour, it’s no wonder that Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee has been around as long as Tiong Bahru Market itself.
