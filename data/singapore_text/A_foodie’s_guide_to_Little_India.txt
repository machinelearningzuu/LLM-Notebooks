Title: A foodie’s guide to Little India

There’s plenty to see, do and of course eat within Little India.

In this bustling ethnic enclave, you’ll find everything from French food to tapas (Spanish-style appetisers), right next to traditional Indian restaurants and stores. Tantalise your taste buds, with this list of restaurants and eateries to visit.

Flavours of India

Explore the diverse regional cuisines of South Asia, within Little India in Singapore. Start with Mustard, which specialises in Bengali and Punjabi cuisines from the eastern and northern states in India. Punjabi food tends to be distinctively rich and buttery while Bengali flavours are fiery yet subtle. Must-tries include chingri maacher malai curry (coconut milk-based prawn curry) and amritsari machhi (deep-fried fish covered with chickpea batter). Next, sample more North Indian dishes such as naan and chapati at Jaggi’s Northern Indian Cuisine. Pair these flatbreads with butter chicken and other delicious gravy dips. Tip: If you can, dine in a large group to sample a bit of everything on the menu. Can’t decide between North or South Indian cuisines? Visit Banana Leaf Apolo, a popular restaurant that serves dishes from both regions of India. True to its name, patrons savour food off banana leaves at this restaurant. Must-try items include the restaurant’s famed fish head curry, chicken masala (spicy yoghurt-based gravy) and tandoori chicken.

South Indian eatery and catering chain Komala Vilas is another hot favourite. Its Serangoon Road outlet has been visited by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015. Popular dishes include dosai (fermented rice and lentil crepe) and vadai (fried fritters). While you’re there, be sure to visit its sweets store nearby at 82 Serangoon Road, and sample its traditional desserts.

Head over to Khansama Tandoori Restaurant, to dine al fresco on a balmy evening. Our top picks include tandoori chicken (chicken roasted with yoghurt and spices) and naan (flatbreads). This two-storey North Indian restaurant has an air-conditioned section, too, which offers cooling respite from the heat and from your fiery curries.

If you’re on the hunt for vegetarian dishes, head to Gokul Vegetarian Restaurant, which serves an eclectic mix of Singaporean, Thai as well as North and South Indian cuisines. Find nearly a hundred options, including starters like samosa (fried pastries) and palak paneer (cottage cheese cubes in a spinach gravy).

An international foodie tour

Beyond Little India's authentic Indian-style restaurants, there are international options too.

Try Indian-Chinese fusion cuisine at Sakunthala’s Food Palace, for unique dishes you might not find anywhere else in Singapore. Our favourites include the ever-popular fish head curry, as well as unexpected finds like seafood naan (flatbread stuffed with seafood).

For a tantalising meal that fuses local flavours with a dash of Western flair, visit The Malayan Council. This beloved local eatery may be famous for its ondeh ondeh (glutinous rice balls filled with liquid palm sugar and coated in grated coconut) cakes, but it also serves up main dishes. The smoke duck lemak cili padi linguine puts a spicy spin on Italian pasta, while their roti kirai beef rib boasts succulent whole beef short rib, with roti kirai (pancake that bears visual resemblance to a net) on the side to sop up the fiery-red gravy.

To sate your late-night hunger pangs, we suggest visiting Swee Choon Dim Sum at Jalan Besar. This popular supper spot has been around since 1962, and serves up a delectable smorgasbord of Hong Kong-style dim sum (bite-sized snacks served in small steamer baskets). Bring a couple of friends and experience Asian-style communal dining with staples like siew mai (pork and shrimp dumplings) and custard buns.
