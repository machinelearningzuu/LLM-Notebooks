Title: Nanyang Sauce — Hello! Singapore Tours

3rd generation owner of Nanyang Sauce, Ken Koh is well acquainted with the craft of soya sauce production, having spent childhood days working in the family business. Up till today, the soya sauce is still made traditionally, the same way Ken’s late grandfather, the founder of Nanyang Sauce, did it. Non-genetically modified soya beans are steamed before they are placed into large clay vats with salt water and wheat flour to ferment under the sun for nine months.
