Beautifully-woven scarves, elegant women’s wear and sparkling jewellery are just some of the treasures you’ll find in the Lion City. Check out our guide to local fashion labels, and discover a range of wares proudly made in Singapore.

For instance, the bestselling Ninja Echo is designed with special slits for wearers to conveniently plug in their wired earphones through the headscarf.

Outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the Aqua Sol range of turbans and caps, which are made from lycra and specially designed for water and land sports.

What was meant to be a break from their advertising careers for both Kenny Lim and Andrew Loh resulted in the inception of homegrown label Depression.

10. Ling Wu

You can recognise a signature Ling Wu handbag by its characteristic, buttery soft leather and glossy finish, the result of a special technique employed by Indonesian artisans where every piece of leather is painstakingly rolled with glass bottles.

Designed by homegrown talent Goh Ling Ling—alumnus of renowned Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London—her luxurious bubble clutches and hobo bags feature python skins that are sustainably sourced from Java and Sumatra.

If you have always been curious about how a designer lives and works, pay a visit to her showroom in the trendy neighbourhood of Chip Bee Gardens.

The relaxed, versatile cut of their resort-style jumpsuits, dhoti-inspired pants and maxi dresses make going from brunch to business meeting a breeze.
