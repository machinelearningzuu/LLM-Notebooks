Title: Malay Heritage Centre

The Malay Heritage Centre is a must-visit for visitors who are keen to learn about the rich heritage and culture of Singapore’s Malay community. Formerly the royal residence of Malay sultans in Singapore, the museum houses exhibitions and a diverse collection of artefacts from the National Collection and the Malay community. In 2015, the museum was gazetted as a National Monument.

Visitors to the Malay Heritage Centre can learn about the rich heritage, culture and contributions of Singapore’s Malay community, as well as the community’s connections to the wider Nusantara (Malay Archipelago) through artefacts and exhibitions.
