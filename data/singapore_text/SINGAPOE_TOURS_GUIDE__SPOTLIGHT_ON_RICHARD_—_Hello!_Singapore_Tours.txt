Title: SINGAPOE TOURS GUIDE: SPOTLIGHT ON RICHARD â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

My favourite Satay stall is at Chinatown Food Center. There are many Satay stalls in this food center but the one I like best is tucked away in a corner. This particular family-run stall makes satay that is juicy, tender and perfectly grilled. They use a traditional Hainanese recipe which offers pineapple puree in their peanut sauce, that compliments the satay.
