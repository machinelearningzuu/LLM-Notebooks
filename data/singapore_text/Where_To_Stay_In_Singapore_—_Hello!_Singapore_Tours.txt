Title: Where To Stay In Singapore â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Characteristics: The Civic District and the Quays are at the very core of Singapore and are best known for its important government buildings such as the Supreme Court, Central Fire Station and National Library. You can also find fascinating museums, protected parks and memorial spaces.

Transport: This is where you are right in the middle of everything and can take any bus or any MRT to anywhere in Singapore!

Pros: From the Civic District take a bumboat ride on the Singapore River, and visit the Quays - our beloved nightlife district and tourist hotspot, with buzzing bars, eclectic eateries and iconic clubs spread across Robertson Quay, Boat Quay and Clarke Quay.

Cons: If you are not into nightlife this area might not be the right one for you to stay.
