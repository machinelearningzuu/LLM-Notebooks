Title: Meet Li Ruifang, third generation hawker chef-owner

Before helming 545 Whampoa Prawn Noodles… I worked in multinational corporation (MNC) for a few years, but couldn’t find purpose in my job. I quit the company and found myself helping out at my father’s stall while considering my options. Eventually, I opened my own stall in Tekka, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve made.

A solid bowl of prawn noodles… should have a flavoursome broth. I use only wild-caught prawns for the sweetness they give. For dry prawn noodles, the balance of the condiments is crucial.

What I love most about Singapore… is the variety of food options on the island. You can find all kinds of cuisines from Mexican to Russian.
