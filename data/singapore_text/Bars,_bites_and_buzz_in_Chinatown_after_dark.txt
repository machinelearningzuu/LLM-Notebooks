Chinatown Complex Food Centre

While you won’t be able to sample all the offerings at the 200 stalls housed within Chinatown Complex Food Centre, you’ll certainly be spoilt for choice. Singapore’s largest hawker centre is often packed with hungry locals, so we recommend visiting early to avoid long queues.

If you’re feeling peckish, opt for a pre-drinks snack at Ann Chin Popiah and Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao. The latter is famous for its juicy xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and spicy Szechuan wantons (Chinese dumplings). Hungrier diners should consider stick-to-your-rib classics from Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice or Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck.
