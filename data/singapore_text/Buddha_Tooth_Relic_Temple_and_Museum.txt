Title: Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum

One of the major Buddhist temples in Singapore, this is a fine example of the Chinese Tang dynasty style of architecture in the heart of Chinatown. As its name suggests, the building houses a tooth relic of Buddha, as well as other revered artifacts. Built-in 2007, visitors will marvel at the rich interiors comprising paintings, statues, tapestries and other exhibits related to Buddha and Buddhism. The building also has a roof garden and a vegetarian restaurant in the basement. Admission to the temple is free, and complimentary tours are conducted every Saturday.
