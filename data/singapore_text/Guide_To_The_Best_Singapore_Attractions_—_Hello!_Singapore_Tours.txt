Title: Guide To The Best Singapore Attractions â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Seven thrilling water rides, such as Pipeline Plunge, will get heart rates up while dropping visitors down an elevated chute and then sending them careening down banked turns, radical twists and dips before splashing out in a pool of water. Those who prefer a lazy day in the sun can take a leisurely ride down Adventure River on a tube, drifting past 14 stunning habitats including a lush jungle garden, a mysterious grotto and an underwater tunnel with a sea of marine life swimming above you.

For more immersive experiences, snorkel at Rainbow Reef to enjoy up-close encounters with 20,000 friendly fishes. For a top-up rate of S$18 for adults and S$16 for children or seniors, feed dozens of friendly rays at the Ray Bay and feel their velvety wings on your fingertips as they swim by gracefully.
