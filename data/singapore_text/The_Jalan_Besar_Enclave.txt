Title: The Jalan Besar Enclave

Parallel to Serangoon Road, Jalan Besar is one of the oldest roads in Singapore. In recent years, Jalan Besar and the streets around it have become a hip enclave with a growing number of trendy boutiques, caf√©s, and restaurants. Coffee lovers can check out Chye Seng Huat Hardware, while foodies will love the baked goodies at The Butter Studio Crafters and hobbyists will find much to occupy them at The Refinery, which houses a yakitori (grilled meat on skewers) restaurant on the first floor, a bespoke cocktail bar on the second floor and a craft workshop on the third floor.
