Title: Hip shopping haunts in Singapore

Design Orchard

More than just a mall, Design Orchard is a haven for local artisans and designers, stocking everything from locally-crafted sports apparel and exquisitely-scented perfumes to T-shirts emblazoned with colloquial puns.

Stock up on chic jumpsuits from GINLEE, peruse trendy hoodies and tanktops from Kydra and add some sparkle to your outfit with Marilyn Tan Jewellery.

Somerset 313

If hip threads are up your alley, be sure to mosey on by Somerset 313. A hip hangout frequented by fashion-forward youth, this shopping mall is the perfect shopping destination for the young and young at heart.

Drop by Dr. Martens to pick up a set of new boots for your next rock concert, peruse the threads at Forever 21 or check out the dresses and tops at local label Love, Bonito.
