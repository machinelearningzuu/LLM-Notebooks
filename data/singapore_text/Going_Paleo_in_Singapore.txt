Title: Going Paleo in Singapore

If a caveman didn’t eat it, neither should you—or so goes the mantra of Paleo diet adherents. The nutritional regime centres around meat, eggs, fruit, vegetables and nuts, and has been catapulted into the mainstream in recent years. So it’s no surprise that there are numerous restaurants in the city where you’ll find dishes that abide to the Paleo principles.

Its compelling theory works on a simple premise: The modern diet, dominated by grains, starches, dairy and processed sugar, is not what the human body has evolved to live well on. In fact, believers attribute ‘first world’ ailments such as diabetes and heart disease to those very ingredients.

But in Singapore, we aren’t just keen on setting up establishments that cater to dietary guidelines—The food has to be as delicious as it is good for you. So here are five restaurants and cafés where you can eat well while sticking to your diet.

Super Simple

Our cave-dwelling forebears would approve of the build-it-yourself bowls at Super Simple; chef-owner Jasper Jek doesn’t deep fry anything and his food is MSG-free. Everything comes in a boxed set that you can customise to your Paleo preferences: pick a protein like slow-cooked chicken breast or ribeye steak, then dress it up with greens, veggies, and nuts. And don’t forget to slather on some of Super Simple’s house-made dressings—you’ll want to go for the Paleo-friendly parsley pesto or miso-ginger. China Square Food Centre.

Caveman Food

As its name suggests, Caveman Food only dishes out low-grain and Paleo-friendly food—there are no grains, sugars, dairy or artificial flavours here, and everything is gluten-free. It’s thanks to owner Michael Tan’s own nutritional regime: He was introduced to the Paleo diet a few years ago, and managed to lose five kilograms in four months. Everything on the menu here is kosher for Paleo adherents: Pick chicken, beef or salmon as your protein base, then throw in baked eggs, sweet potato or apple salad to complete your meal.

Ninja Bowl

The restaurant’s mouth-watering, signature bowls come in a variety of flavours, ranging from the Kabuki (chicken leg confit with cherry tomatoes, zucchini and sautéed mushrooms) to the Tontoro (pork jowl, baby corn coleslaw and sesame cucumbers).

All bowls come with an onsen egg for some added protein, and you can choose to add rice or orzo pasta… don’t worry, we won’t tell on you!
