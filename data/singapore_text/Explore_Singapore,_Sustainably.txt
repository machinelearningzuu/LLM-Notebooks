Title: Explore Singapore, Sustainably

Known for being clean and green, Singapore strives to be a sustainable urban destination. Through collective action and the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our city is reducing its impact on the environment with a limitless realm of possibilities for travellers from all walks of life.

About 95 percent of our city’s energy is powered by natural gas, and over half our island is covered in lush trees and green foliage.

Whether you’re a champion of sustainability visiting Singapore or keen to learn more about conserving nature, here’re some of the many ways to get larger-than-life experiences while doing your part to protect our planet.
