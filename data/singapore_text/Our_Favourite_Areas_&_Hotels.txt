Title: Our Favourite Areas & Hotels

Right in the heart of the Kansai region and surrounded in every direction by some of Japan‚Äôs most famous sights lies the modern metropolitan city of Osaka. Famous for its dazzling neon-lit entertainment district, its world-class food, and its friendly people, Osaka has become a popular base for exploring the region. But as Japan‚Äôs third-largest city deciding where to stay in Osaka can easily start to feel quite overwhelming.

Osaka isn‚Äôt always on those must-sees in Japan lists, lacking those world-famous sights that its neighbor Kyoto is so known for. In fact, we actually skipped Osaka on our first couple of trips to Japan, but once we did set foot in this energetic city, it ended up as one of our favorite ‚Äúbig‚Äù cities. Osaka‚Äôs combination of affordable accommodation, world-class food at every street corner, and super convenient location won us over.

We love that within just a short train ride away you can explore the temples of Kyoto, the historic city of Nara, the charming port town of Kobe, and our favorite castle in Japan, the famous Himeji castle.

And the city itself has plenty to offer too, from the famous neon-lit Dotonbori entertainment district to the view from the top of Japan‚Äôs tallest building, from vibrant food markets to centries old eateries, from top-notch luxury shopping to nerdy manga geekery heaven. While it does lack the ancient temples and beautiful gardens that we all love, it makes up for it with its energy, its relaxed friendly atmosphere, and delicious food.

In fact, we liked it so much that we went back at the end of our Japan trip to stay for a while longer üôÇ

One of the results is this guide on where to stay in Osaka with all the little hotel gems that we were able to find. Here we reveal what we think are the best areas to stay in Osaka and why. For each area, we have listed our favorite hotels at any budget ‚Äì Top-End, Mid-Range, and Budget.

By the way, for more details on what to do in Osaka see our complete two-day Osaka Itinerary.

Where to Stay in Osaka

Whether you are looking for that once in a lifetime luxury hotel, a small intimate boutique hotel, a value-for-money business hotel, or a budget guesthouse or hostel, Osaka will deliver.

Finding that perfect hotel or guesthouse for your trip really depends on what your plans and preferences are. Are you in town primarily to see the city attractions, or do you plan to take a lot of day trips to the surrounding sights? Do you prefer a local quiet neighborhood, or do you want easy access to Osaka‚Äôs famous neon-lit nightlife?

Osaka is a big city and it covers a lot of ground, so it‚Äôs worth considering staying somewhere central. Thankfully, Osaka has an excellent transportation system with subways that covers the city very well. The Midosuji subway line in particular is super convenient as it crosses through the city connecting the most popular areas and will get you almost everywhere.

You can easily do day-trips from Osaka to Kyoto (a 25-min train ride), Himeji Castle (30 min), Kobe (30 min), and Nara (1 hour). And if you get up real early in the morning, you can even do day-trips to Hiroshima (1 h, 20 min) and Koyasan (2 hours).

What it does lack is Kyoto‚Äôs huge range of Ryokans (traditional Japanese inns), so if you have your heart set on staying in a Ryokan, Kyoto is the better choice. Have a look at our article on where to stay in Kyoto for our recommendations on Kyoto‚Äôs best hotels and Ryokans.

One of the reasons that Osaka has become a popular place to use as a base is that accommodation in Osaka is generally considered to be fairly affordable compared to for instance Kyoto. While areas such as Kita and Minima have plenty of top-notch luxury hotels, other areas such as Tennoji and around Osaka Castle are more budget-friendly.

And during the holidays and special occasions such as Cherry Blossom season, when Kyoto gets packed with tourists and the hotels fill up, it can be much easier to find a vacant hotel room in Osaka and go on day-trips from here.

Important: None of the hotels recommended here are paid placements or have sponsored our stay in any way. We always pay for our own travel. If you book through any of the links in this article, we make a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps keep our site running ‚Äì so thank you in advance for your support! ‚ô•

We hope you find this guide helpful in finding the best place to stay in Osaka!

The 7 Best Areas To Stay In Osaka





The following seven areas are the best areas to stay in Osaka:

1. Minami Area | Namba Station, Shinsaibashi & Dotombori



The map above: Best hotels in the Minami area of Osaka

Minami, meaning ‚ÄúSouth‚Äù, is Osaka‚Äôs most famous entertainment district with its abundance of bars, restaurants, and shops. This area comes to life after dark when the restaurant streets are filled with both locals and tourists indulging in the famous Osaka food culture.

Minami includes the neighborhoods Namba, Shinsaibashi, Dotombori, Honmachi, and Amerika-Mura.

This area is sometimes simply referred to as Namba. It comes from the subway station of the same name that lies at its center. Here you find several of Osaka‚Äôs most popular attractions, including Osaka‚Äôs best food market ‚Äì the Kuromon Ichiba Market, the old Hozen-ji Temple, and the atmospheric Hozen-jo Yokocho Alley.

But the main attraction is Dotombori, the famous strip of restaurants, food stalls, and bars that line both sides of the canal and display the wildest most colourful display of neon signs anywhere. It‚Äôs the kind of spectacle that takes your breath away. You can spend hours just wandering the side streets, trying out the local specialties, snapping photos, and exploring the small bars and narrow alleys. It‚Äôs great fun!

Why Stay In The Minami Area?

World-class entertainment and dining

Minami, and Namba, is the city center of Osaka. Here you find the vibrant street food and nightlife that Osaka is so famous for. It is also home to most of the restaurants, cafes, shops, and pubs that have earned Osaka the title of Japan‚Äôs food capital.

By staying in the Minami/ Namba area, you are right in the middle of the action, and there is always something new to see and do, or something to eat, around the next corner.

Huge range of accommodation options available

This is Osaka‚Äôs most famous and visited area and as such there is no shortage of hotels and guesthouses offering accommodation no matter what your budget is.

Lots to explore

From famous food markets to old shrines and atmospheric alleyways, Minami is a real treat explore. There is always a photo opportunity lurking around every corner.



Convenient access to subway and train

It is also very well connected, and you can easily base yourself in Namba and explore Osaka city from here. There are two large subway stations, The Namba Subway Station and Shinsaibashi Subway Station, both on the Mido-suji Subway Line.

You can also take the train to/ from the JR Namba Railway Station, where the Yamatoji Railway Line stops, or use the Nankai Line and the Kintetsu Line. This makes it easy to go on day trips to for instance Wakayama or Nara from Minami.

And if you‚Äôre a foodie, there is really no place better to be!

Dotombori

Dotombori is the place to head to in the evenings. This is where most of the restaurants, bars, and pubs are located, and the whole neighborhood transforms into a bustling and energetic street market after dark. The area is famous for all its neon signs, weird and wonderful giant wall signs depicting blowfish, crabs, and other creatures. It is a very popular photo spot and here is hangs the famous neon sign that depicts Glico man, also known as the running man.

Check out our Osaka Itinerary for our recommended walking route that covers all the main sights of the Dotombori & Amerika-mura area. Amerika-Mura

A hip and trendy neighborhood packed with cool shops, cafes, bars, and nightclubs inspired by American street ware and culture. Nippombashi & Kuromon Ichiba Market

Kuromon Ichiba Market is Osaka‚Äôs best food market and a must-visit if you are a foodie. A great way to experience this market is by joining a food tour with a local guide. Hozen-ji Temple & Hozen-ji Yokocho Alley

A tiny temple with moss-covered stone figures hidden in an atmospheric stone-brick alley with old traditional restaurants and bars. Shinsaibashi

Go shopping along the two parallel shopping streets Midosuji avenue and Shinsaibashi Shopping Arcade. Here you will find everything from luxury international brands to budget shops. Namba Yasaka Shrine

The astonishing Namba Yasaka Shrine, with its giant roaring lion head, is quite the sight and well worth a visit.

We simply L-O-V-E-D our room! Big, bright and delicate room with a huge comfortable bed, a sofa, a table, a big tv, a chair, two free water bottles, a fridge, and a kettle. We also got robes, slippers, and all kinds of toiletries. And the bathroom is big too, which is a bit rare in Japan. We had a great view of Osaka city and a small temple next door. We slept like babies as the rooms are very soundproof, and there was no noise from neither the street nor the neighboring rooms.

The hotel has fully automatic washing machines on the 6th floor, which was very convenient. And some floors have wending machines and microwave ovens. The hotel has a nice restaurant, a bar, and a gym.

The free wifi in our room was super fast, we watched both cross-country skiing and biathlon from a Norwegian tv channel, and it worked smoothly. The room also has a spacious safe, which could fit both our laptops (13‚Ä≥ and 15‚Ä≥). We ended up staying seven nights at Osaka Excel Hotel Tokyu as we loved it so much.

2. Kita Area | Umeda Station & Osaka‚Äôs business district

Ôªø Ôªø

The map above: Best hotels in the Kita Area of Osaka

Kita, meaning ‚ÄúNorth‚Äú, is considered Osaka‚Äôs business district with its tall modern skyscrapers and office buildings. Kita may lack a little of the local Japanese flavor, but it still is one of the best areas to stay in Osaka with large department stores and shopping complexes with plenty of dining, and entertainment options.

It‚Äôs a pleasant and safe area to explore on foot with its pedestrian-friendly wide sidewalks and it also has its fair share of sights with the spectacular Umeda Sky building as our personal favorite.

Kita is also arguably the best-connected area in Osaka as no less than four train lines converge here, as well as the Midosuji subway that stops at its center. This makes it an excellent base both for exploring the city and for taking day trips to the surrounding sights.

Why Stay In The Kita Area?

Modern and convenient with some of Osaka‚Äôs best hotels

Kita is not as busy as Minami, though it is still considered part of downtown Osaka. Since this is the business district this is where you find many of the city‚Äôs international luxury and upper-midrange hotels.

While there is no shortage of restaurants the area itself gets fairly quiet at night, perfect for a good night‚Äôs sleep. If you prefer to party the night away then your just a short hop away from Dotonbori‚Äôs nightlife.

Osaka‚Äôs best-connected transportation hub

Kita is the perfect area to stay in if you want easy access to transportation to the neighboring cities. Some highlights of the transportation option in Kita include:

JR Osaka Station ‚Äì Osaka‚Äôa largest train station, and from here you can take the JR Osaka Loop Line, JR Kyoto Line, and JR Kobe Line.

‚Äì Osaka‚Äôa largest train station, and from here you can take the JR Osaka Loop Line, JR Kyoto Line, and JR Kobe Line.

Things To See And Do In Kita Area

Umeda Sky Building

A museum dedicated to teaching kids through play, hands-on learning, and workshops.

What‚Äôs The Catch?

While there are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area, Kita cannot quite match the nightlife in the Minami area with Dotombori and its hundreds of restaurants. Its modern architecture means that it lacks the historic building and old cozy alleyways of Minami.

The Ritz-Carlton Osaka

It‚Äôs hard to go wrong with the Ritz Carlton and the Osaka hotel is no exception. A stunning 5-star hotel with world-class service and a perfect location, only a 7-minute walk from JR Osaka Station, and a 5-minute walk from Nishi-Umeda Subway Station.

It‚Äôs simply super comfortable and clean, with surprisingly large rooms (enough space for several suitcases), friendly staff, and incredible city views through large windows. The location is equally top-notch, with Hankyu Umeda Station only 3 min away by foot, and JR Osaka Station less than 10 min.

Hotel Wing International Select Osaka Umeda

Have you seen the movie ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù from 2013 starring Leonardo DiCaprio? This hotel is like taken out of that movie! It has the same 20th-century design and vibe to it. Even the hotel‚Äôs cafe and bar is called Gatsby, which I find very fitting. An extras bonus is the free welcome drink in the Gatsby bar.

The rooms are small but very stylish, clean, and comfortable, and they all come with a private bathroom with a bathtub. You can‚Äôt beat the price and the location, just a 5-10 min walk from JR Osaka Station with lots of restaurants and shopping streets right around the corner. A good deal!

Nest Hotel Osaka Umeda

I love the design of this hotel, especially the welcoming lobby area with its cozy seating. Well-equipped, although small rooms, with a relaxed vibe. Good location not far from Umeda Station (a 10-min walk). The price is a real bonus for this central location. Modern and clean, the hotel opened in October 2018, so still relatively new. The complimentary breakfast is okay, coffee, bread, and muffins, but nothing special. However, there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby.

3. Tennoji Area | Shinsekai & Tsutenkaku Tower

Ôªø Ôªø

The map above: Best hotels in the Tennoji area of Osaka

Tennoji is the old part of Osaka, it lies just south of Minami, and you can easily walk between these two areas. Once it had a reputation as a slightly seedy area, but Tennoji has seen quite the revival in later years, especially since Japan‚Äôs tallest building Abeno Harukas finished construction in 2014.

The area around Shinsekai is very photogenic with Osaka‚Äôs answer to the Eiffel Tower, Tsutenkaku Tower, at its center.

Why Stay In The Tennoji Area?

Cheap and plentiful food

You will find lots of cheap restaurants in this area, especially in the Shinsekai neighborhood of Tennoji. Many of the restaurants here specialize in Kushikatsu, battered, deep-fried meat and vegetables on skewers, which goes perfectly together with a beer or two.

Relaxed atmosphere and budget-friendly accommodation

Tennoji is a bit more relaxed than busy Minami, though it has a bustling bar and restaurant street. It is also a great area to look for budget accommodation.

Well connected

Tennoji station is very well connected being on the main Midosuji line as well as on the Osaka loop line.

Things To See And Do In Tennoji Area

Shinsekai Neighborhood

Shinsekai meaning ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù, has become the old town of Osaka. It used to be a cutting-edge amusement park but time has transformed it into a cool entertainment district full of cheap restaurants and bars with a retro vibe.

Japan‚Äôs first human rights museum, opened in 1985.

What‚Äôs The Catch?

The Shinsekai neighborhood of Tennoji is starting to show its age and some parts are frankly looking a little run down.

It also gets busy and loud in the evenings, especially during weekends and public holidays, when the crowds flock to the many restaurants and pubs in search of cheap food and drinks.

An excellent 5-star hotel with a brilliant location in the Abeno Harukas building, Japan‚Äôs tallest building!

4. Honmachi Area



The map above: Best hotels in the Honmachi area of Osaka

Osaka‚Äôs downtown is split between two areas, Kita to the north and Minami to the south. Right in the middle of them lies Honmachi, a much quieter neighborhood that is for the most part office and residential in nature.

Apart from one of central Osaka‚Äôs most popular parks, Utsubo Park, there really isn‚Äôt a lot of sights to see here. But there are some excellent hotels in the area, and prices here generally tend to be lower than downtown.

Honmachi has its own subway station on the Midosuji line so you can use the subway to get around. But, the area‚Äôs central location also means that if you, like us, love to walk, you can walk to both Kita and Minami.

Why Stay In Honmachi

Quiet yet central

If you prefer to stay in a quiet area and still be able to walk to downtown Osaka, then Honmachi is a great choice.

Some excellent hotels at more affordable prices

There are some excellent hotels in the Honmachi area, and since it is considered slightly less central accommodation prices tend to be lower than in more central areas.

Utsubo-Koen Park is another reason why you might want to stay in Honmachi. It provides a welcome green escape in an area that otherwise has very few parks. There is a rose garden with over 160 different kinds of roses, and a tennis center that sometimes arranges international tennis tournaments. The park is a popular picnic spot on the weekends and late afternoons, and in spring it is one of Osaka‚Äôs most popular places to see the Cherry blossom trees in full bloom.

Things To See And Do In Honmachi

Utsubo Park

As one of central Osaka‚Äôs very few parks, it is a great place to go for a walk, relax or join the locals on a picnic. There is also a rose garden and a tennis center with 16 courts. It is one of Osaka‚Äôs most popular spots for Cherry Blossom.

What‚Äôs The Catch?

It does get very quiet in the evenings, and the neighborhood doesn‚Äôt have many sights to see.
