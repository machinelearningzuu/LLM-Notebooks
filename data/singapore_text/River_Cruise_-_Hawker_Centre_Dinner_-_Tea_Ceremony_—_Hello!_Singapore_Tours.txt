Title: River Cruise - Hawker Centre Dinner - Tea Ceremony — Hello! Singapore Tours

This tour is packed full of ‘must see’ and ‘must do’ highlights. We cover some very interesting historical and political subjects and can go as deep or as light as you like on them. Our promise is to keep it fun and informative.

If you are a vegetarian we promise to get you something to eat at the Hawker Centre but we can not guarantee what will be available, it might be quite basic (like rice and veg). If the rooftop of The Pinnacle is closed due to bad weather we will take you to a different HDB building. If the teahouse is closed we will have a bigger dinner section.

This tour requires you to be fit and be able to walk 9 km. We do walk at a slow casual pace but if you tire easily a group tour will not be suitable for you. Instead, book a private tour so that we can cut down walking by taking the occasional taxi ride.
