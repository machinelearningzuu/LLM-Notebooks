Title: Raffles Hotel — Hello! Singapore Tours

A destination unto itself, the grand historic hotel exudes old-world grandeur infused with the unique charm of Singapore and timeless luxury. First opened in 1887, the hotel has since been given a new lease of life after an extensive two-year revamp. Visitors can look forward to immersing themselves in striking colonial architecture and graceful service as well as newly opened bars, restaurants, courtyards, and social spaces.

Innovative and contemporary in-suite technology touchpoints are also available, along with refreshed bathroom facilities and amenities. Rooms at Raffles Hotel Singapore offer complimentary minibars, part of the hotel’s enriched guest offerings. Guests looking to wind down after a day of exploration should try the hotel’s signature Singapore Sling experience.
