Title: Value-for-money food in Singapore

With hundreds of options ranging from hawker centres to high-end restaurants, it can be tough deciding where to feast in Singapore’s foodie paradise. When in doubt, you can’t go wrong by pleasing both your wallet and delighting your taste buds—with food that’s delicious as well as value-for-money.

Singapore is home to many fantastic restaurants that hit the sweet spot of great food and ambience, at prices that are truly a steal. Check out some of the best bang-for-your-buck eateries—including Michelin-starred names—in Singapore.

For meat lovers

Aburi-EN

Discerning carnivores looking to bring their food experiences to the next level should check out the premiums cuts of meat sold at Aburi-EN.

While high-quality wagyu beef usually commands premium prices (sometimes to the tune of up to S$300 for 300 grams), this establishment offers tasty beef bowls from just S$19, bursting with delicious umami flavour.

The restaurant serves Miyazaki Wagyu that’s A5-grade—the highest classification for beef—famous for its deep marbling and melt-in-your-mouth tenderness.

Besides beef, another value-for-money staple at Aburi-EN is the buta (Japanese for ‘pork’), made from chestnut-fed pigs, resulting in extremely tender meat that’s sweeter than regular pork.

After being expertly flame-seared over Japanese white charcoal—a unique method which results in a subtle smokiness—the meats are served on top-quality, chewy Yamagata Haenuki rice.

Guoco Tower. 7 Wallich Street #B2-09, Singapore 078884. +65 6214 3570.

Daily 11am-10pm.

Osia Steak and Seafood Grill Sitting right in the heart of Sentosa, Osia is also the perfect place for a romantic dinner. While you’ll certainly be able to find more affordable grill-houses across the island, it’s unlikely you’ll find meat prepared to world-class standards at these price points (the restaurant was lauded with one Michelin star from 2016-2018). With premium meats specially flown in from Australia, it’s small wonder that Michelin-starred Osia Steak and Seafood Grill has been lauded by meat lovers and gourmands alike. The juicy steaks at this restaurant go for as little as S$48, and if you’re having their set lunch instead, you can get a generous slab of foie gras (S$12) as an add-on. The special stone hearth oven grills the meats to smoky perfection, making them especially sweet and tender. Resorts World™ Sentosa. 26 Sentosa Gateway (Festive Walk) #02-140/141, Singapore 098138. +65 6577 6560.

Daily noon-2.30pm, 6-10pm.

For a taste of Asia

Hotpot Heroes

Chinese steamboat (colloquially known as hotpot) is a communal affair where diners dunk fresh ingredients into a steaming bowl of broth. If this sounds like a tantalizing way to spend the evening with your loved ones, be sure to visit Hotpot Heroes.

If you’re in the mood to sample the more exotic tastes of East Asian fare, be sure to sample the Duck Tongue in XO sauce (S$12 per plate). The Crispy Roasted Pork (S$18.80) is also a hugely popular dish, with just the right amount of crunch atop tender meat. Don’t miss the desserts either—go for the Lei Garden-signature, an irresistible Chilled Mango Sweetener with Grapefruit and Sago (S$8).

For authentic European delights

Saveur If you’re craving for French staples, be sure to head over to Saveur. This chain of restaurant first shot to fame for offering local diners high-quality French classics—like foie gras and duck confit—at affordable prices. Start with the popular Saveur Pasta (S$9), a dish of springy capellini pasta splashed with sakura ebi, pork sauce, and truffle oil. Don’t be fooled by the subtle flavour at the onset—the dish becomes more irresistible with every mouthful. Or go fancy with the Pan Seared Foie Gras (S$14), for a generous serving of aromatic duck liver. The authentic French mains are equally delicious—regulars rave about the Duck Confit (S$19) which is well worth its price for juicy meat that’s crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Saveur. 5 Purvis Street #01-04, Singapore 188584. +65 6331 3121.

Daily noon-9.30pm.
