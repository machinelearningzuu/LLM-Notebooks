Title: IRVINS Salted Egg Fish Skin by IRVINS Salted Egg — Hello! Singapore Tours

Touted as the original #DangerouslyAddictive snack from Singapore, IRVINS Salted Egg are handcrafted with love by dedicated production teams who spend hours frying and coating the chips and fish skin with their golden salted egg sauce. The halal-certified salted egg-coated chips and fried fish skins were founded by the former restaurant owner, Irvin Gunawan, after seeing the popularity of his bottled salted egg chips among restaurant patrons.

The outlets have seen snaking lines even before they open. Visitors can stock up on IRVINS’ salted egg potato chips, fish skins and cassava chips at the orchardgateway and Plaza Singapura cartels or the newly opened flagship Jewel cartel. For delivery or reservation of these snacks, visitors may place orders via IRVINS’ website
