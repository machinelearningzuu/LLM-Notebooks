Title: Singapore Activities — Hello! Singapore Tours

A visit to Singapore would not be complete without a meal at a hawker centre. It is where visitors can find Singaporeans from all walks of life tucking into affordable local food in a casual setting. At these open-air food courts, the best local dishes can be sampled for under S$10. This includes delicious meals from different ethnic groups—Chinese, Indian, Malay and Eurasian—as well as halal and vegetarian options.

From the hustle and bustle to the sights and smells, visiting a lively hawker centre is a sensory experience not to be missed. Though stalls may operate at different timings, hawker centres generally open from early morning till late.

If you would like to explore a Hawker Centre and learn more about the food and culture with a guide, book onto one of our tours. Our Food Tours visit Old Airport Road Hawker Centre and our History and Culture tours visit Maxwell Hawker Centre. If you book a Private Customised Tour we can take you to any hawker centre that you like.
