Title: Local Homeware and Crafts by Supermama â€” Hello! Singapore Tours

Supermama works with some of the best designers and craft facilities to produce authentic souvenirs and design pieces. A unique souvenir to bring home would be the Singapore Recipe Tea Towels which made its debut at Moma Design Store, New York. Other bespoke finds from the brand include homeware such as handcrafted wooden teacups, porcelain plates, toys, furniture and accessories. In 2019, Supermama opened its second boutique in Jewel Changi Airport.

Visitors will find minimalist design pieces produced in collaborations between local designers and Japanese craft facilities, as well as a changing showcase of locally designed porcelain that they can browse and even bring home.
