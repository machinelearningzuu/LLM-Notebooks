Title: Enjoy Singapore in 7 days

More than just a bustling metropolis, Singapore is a city where bold new passions are just waiting to be uncovered.

Begin your discovery of our city’s most popular attractions at Gardens by the Bay. This 101-hectare space of verdant greenery comprises three massive cooled conservatories filled with natural splendour.

You’ll be able to spend most of the day marvelling at the rare flora on display at the Flower Dome, exploring the mist-filled landscape of Cloud Forest, and marvelling at the majesty of the garden’s Supertrees. Be sure to scale Cloud Mountain for unforgettable views, and snap a photo or two atop the OCBC Skyway.
