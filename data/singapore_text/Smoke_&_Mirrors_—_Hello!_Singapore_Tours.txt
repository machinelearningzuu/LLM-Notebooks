Title: Smoke & Mirrors — Hello! Singapore Tours

Perched on the rooftop of the iconic National Gallery Singapore, Smoke & Mirrors is a destination bespoke bar that provides a spectacular panoramic view of the Padang and Marina Bay and sets out to elevate the cocktail experience by exploring classic drinks with experimental new twists. Helmed by Head Bartender Jorge A. Conde, the bar’s innovative cocktail menu is driven by modern techniques, unique flavour combinations and named ‘Illusion of Flavours’–featuring sixteen progressive cocktails that reimagine classic cocktails.

These include concoctions such as Dali’s Self Portrait (S$28++), which pay homage to Salvador Dali’s artwork–‘Soft Self-Portrait with Grilled Bacon’ and puts a twist on the classic Manhattan by adding bacon fat and artichoke to a whiskey and vermouth base. With plenty of woods, copper tones and warm lighting, Smoke & Mirrors exudes magnetic intimacy.
