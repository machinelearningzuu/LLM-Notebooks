Title: Merlion Park — Hello! Singapore Tours

The Merlion Park is where visitors can admire Singapore’s iconic Merlion–a must-see for tourists visiting the island. The water-spouting Merlion has a body of a fish, symbolising Singapore’s humble beginnings as a fishing village, while its lion head symbolises Singapore’s original name, Singapura, or ‘lion city’ in Malay.

It was built by local craftsman, Lim Nang Seng, and was unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the mouth of the Singapore River, to welcome all visitors to Singapore.
