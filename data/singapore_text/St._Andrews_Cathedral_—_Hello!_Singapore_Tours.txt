Title: St. Andrews Cathedral — Hello! Singapore Tours

After the original chapel on the site of the present building was destroyed by two lightning strikes in 1852, it was torn down. In its place, a cathedral with early English Gothic influences was built. Designed by Colonel Ronald MacPherson in 1856, St Andrew’s Cathedral is Singapore’s largest cathedral and the most established Anglican place of worship. Located in the bustling Civic District, where modern Singapore began, its design pays fitting tribute to key historical figures. Stained glass windows on the apse honour Singapore’s founder, Sir Stamford Raffles, and other British officials.

In 1942 during World War II, there were frequent Japanese air raids and the cathedral was used as an emergency hospital. It was gazetted as a national monument in 1973. Free guided tours are available for advance booking on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 10.30 am to 3 pm and on Thursday at 3 pm. Its Cathedral Café, which also acts as a welcome centre, is open daily from 9 am to 5 pm.
