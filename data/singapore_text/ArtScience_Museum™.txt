Title: ArtScience Museum™

As the name suggests, ArtScience Museum™ at Marina Bay Sands® beautifully fuses art and science to tell fascinating stories. This premier venue houses a constantly changing line-up of major international touring exhibitions, brought in through collaborations with organisations such as the American Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Institute and world-renowned furniture designer Herman Miller.

Where Art meets Science

The ArtScience Museum™ has housed renowned exhibitions that push the boundaries of science, technology and knowledge. “The Deep”, an exhibition on deep-sea life, saw the largest collection of abyssal creatures ever displayed in Southeast Asia, and “The Nobel Prize: Ideas Changing the World” showcased how Nobel Prize-awarded efforts have shaped and continue to change our world.

Other exhibitions at the ArtScience Museum™ have also featured a multitude of works from the Arts and creative fields—from multimedia art pieces by Eric Valli that reflect life along the Yangtze River, to an insight into the art of animation with DreamWorks Animation: The Exhibition.

The museum is also home to the permanent exhibition, FUTURE WORLD: Where Art Meets Science. Visitors can immerse themselves in a dynamic 1,500-square-metre digital universe of interactive art installations revolving around the themes of Nature, Town, Park and Science.

Eye-catching design

Not only does the museum push boundaries with its retinue of world-class exhibitions, its design architecture is equally as iconic. The museum’s structure is meant to symbolise the welcoming hand of Singapore with ten fingers. The tip of each “finger” filters in natural light to showcase exhibits in the best light. There are 21 galleries spread over three storeys with a total floor space of about 50,000 square feet.
