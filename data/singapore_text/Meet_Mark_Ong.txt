Title: Meet Mark Ong

Meet

Mark

SNEAKER ARTIST, STREETWEAR DESIGNER

With a dedicated following of sneaker collectors both locally and abroad, Mark channels punk’s unbridled spirit in his shoe customisations and streetwear designs. Inspired by his painter father and the rebellious nature of punk rock, a young Mark spent countless evenings sketching cartoons of the 1990s in his science textbooks.

He spent the days of his youth skateboarding at the Padang, an activity that still influences his iconic designs. In 2002, he sold his first pair of customised Nikes online, a sale that kick-started his journey as a pioneer in the field of sneaker design. Since then, Mark’s home-grown label—SBTG—has attracted the attention of international celebrities like Kobe Bryant.
