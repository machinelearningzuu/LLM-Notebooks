Title: Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay

There are few buildings in Singapore as eye-catching as Esplanade, a world-class performing arts centre made up of two rounded glass domes fitted with over 7,000 triangular aluminium sunshades.

Locals have dubbed it "the Durian", as the venue’s twin structures resemble the spiky tropical fruit that is unique to this part of the world.

With its bold design, the space has become synonymous with the country, a funky complement to the symmetry of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer that sit nearby.

Designed by leading local firm DP Architects, the space features a 1,600-seat Concert Hall where the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and other local, regional and international music acts regularly perform. If you’re in the mood for some Shakespeare or perhaps a modern dance performance, chances are you’ll find it at the 2,000-seat Theatre next door.



The centre also houses a Recital Studio, Theatre Studio, an Outdoor Theatre, Annexe Studio and visual art exhibition spaces that round off the arts offerings. A slew of cafes, restaurants and shops support the throngs of theatre and concert goers that have made this one of the busiest, and architecturally captivating, performing arts centres in the region.
