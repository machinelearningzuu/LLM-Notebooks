Title: Singapore City Gallery

There are few places in the world that have transformed themselves from a humble trading port to a first-world metropolis in the short span of five decades.

Singaporeâ€™s rapid evolution has been accompanied by remarkable physical transformation, with skyscrapers and other iconic structures emerging to create a distinctive city skyline.

Singapore City Gallery documents the nation's planning challenges and effort in over ten thematic areas, with more than 50 audiovisual and interactive exhibits spanning three floors.

One key attraction is the massive architectural model that gives you a bird's eye view of the city centre, which comes alive with a light and sound show. Another key attraction allows you to immerse yourself in the city through a 270-degree panoramic show that depicts scenes of daily life in Singapore from dusk to dawn.

You may also want to check out the other interactive activities to get a taste of city planning and insights into the country's conservation efforts. It's a multi-sensory experience that takes you deep into Singapore's exciting planning journey.
