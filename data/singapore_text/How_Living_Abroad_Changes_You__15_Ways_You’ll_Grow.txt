Ever wonder how living abroad changes you? Although some may answer that a living experience or a trip in another part of the world doesn’t change you in any aspect, Giorgy from G-Extreme Travel has something else to say about it.

Living abroad is a unique and life-changing experience that will leave you completely different in ways you didn’t know were possible.

From how you view the world to how you communicate with new people, living outside of your home country can be an eye-opening journey full of self-discovery and growth.

Are you ready to be changed forever? Inhabiting a foreign nation can completely alter your life, just like it did for me. To demonstrate how much of an impact living abroad will have, here is a list of 15 reasons why!

1. Make you more creative

For sure, living abroad can make you more creative in so many ways.

New environments and cultures force you to step out of your comfort zone, think outside the box, and come up with innovative solutions.

When living in a new country, you’re exposed to new ideas and different ways of doing things. This encourages you to think more creatively and critically when it comes to problem-solving.

For example, I spent a year living in Cartagena, Colombia, and encountered a personal issue that required me to make an appointment with the doctor.

At first, this seemed daunting as my Spanish was far from perfect, however, I decided to go to the appointment anyway, downloading a translation app in case I was struggling with explaining the problem. In the end, everything worked out well – we ended up laughing and speaking Spanglish!

Furthermore, living abroad can offer you a sense of freedom and liberation that allows your creativity to flourish.

Without the pressures of society, families, and new friends from back home, it’s easier to follow your dreams and be true to yourself.

So, if you want to cultivate your creativity and break out of your comfort zone, living abroad may be the perfect opportunity!

2. Improve communication skills

Whether you’re dealing with a language barrier or just trying to make new friends, living in a new country will provide you with plenty of chances to practice your communication skills.

When living in a new country, you’ll have the opportunity to learn the language of your host nation and become proficient in it. With practice and dedication, you can start to understand native speakers and even participate in conversations with them. Not only will this make everyday life much easier but it will also help create meaningful relationships with people from different cultures.

The cultural richness of learning a new language along with living abroad is invaluable. Learning a new language gives you insight into an entirely new way of life, which is why I was so transformed after moving to a new country.

So don’t be afraid to jump in and take the plunge. You never know what amazing experiences await you!

3. Make you a better job candidate

Living abroad can be a great way to enhance your job prospects. It gives you a unique insight into different cultures, languages, customs, and ways of doing business that can prove invaluable in the workplace.

Such as how to manage yourself in unfamiliar environments, as well as develop important interpersonal skills. All of these experiences can make you a more attractive job candidate and give you an edge over the competition.

It can help you develop greater flexibility and adaptability. When exposed to different ways of thinking, working, and managing situations, you become better equipped to handle change in your home country. This skill is particularly sought after in today’s ever-changing world of work.

Developing your communication skills will let you learn how to express yourself clearly in a language other than your mother tongue, as well as interact with people from different backgrounds. This can be especially helpful for international companies looking for employees who can bridge cultural and language gaps.

Moreover, developing cross-cultural understanding can bring tremendous value to any employer that works with or in other countries.

Overall, living abroad can make you an attractive job candidate and open up opportunities that would otherwise not be available. So if you’re looking to stand out from the pack, consider spending some time living in a foreign country.

I recommend this platform to find jobs as a foreigner.

4. Improve cognitive abilities

Living abroad provides an invaluable experience to improve cognitive abilities, as the process of adapting to a new culture shock and language stimulates your brain in ways you never experienced before.

When living in a foreign country, you are constantly exposed to new languages, customs, cultures, and beliefs that require you to think critically about how you interact with the people around you.

By living abroad, your brain is not only developing the ability to process new information but also how to think differently about how you approach a problem or situation.

The unique experiences that come with living in a foreign country force your brain to remain active and engaged as it adapts from one environment to another. This cognitive stimulation will help to improve your overall thinking skills and how you approach problem-solving in both personal and professional life.

5. Make you more productive

Recharging energy and feeling more productive is a common feeling when someone moves to a new country and adopts a healthier different lifestyle.

Living abroad allows you to focus on the present and how you can make the most of your experience. You settle into a different life, with different routines that may be less hectic or more relaxed than what you are used to. These positive changes make you more productive.

Spending a week in a community in the Amazon Rainforest changed my outlook on life. Seeing how people with fewer resources were happier made me realize that complaining of not having something was frivolous and selfish.

6. Make you more independent

It’s still a mystery to me why some people are terrified of being alone. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t equate with loneliness; instead, you gain independence and freedom from others that may be hesitant or too intimidated to bother to enter your life.

Living abroad will give you the opportunity to understand how you can cope with being on your own and how to stand strong during moments of despair. You learn how to make decisions on your own and how to solve problems without depending on someone else’s opinion.

In my case, my experience moving to another country helped me to realize how much of an independent person I really was. You learn how to trust yourself for decisions made, how to be aware of the thoughts that come into your mind, and how to process them in a mature way!

7. Improve problem solving skills

Living abroad pushes you out of your comfort zone, as it is full of obstacles and unknown variables.

Every day, you are faced with a new challenge that requires a lot of problem-solving, from how to find a good work-life balance to how to relocate.

These experiences help you develop your problem-solving skills and sharpen your analytical thinking which will be beneficial in the future. You learn how to be resilient and how to recognize opportunities when they present themselves.

At first, it can be difficult, but with persistence and practice, you will become better at troubleshooting.

That’s how living abroad changes you and how it can shape your life for the better!

8. Helps you find yourself

When you leave your comfort zone and dive into unfamiliar new cultures and habits, it becomes easier to examine how you think, how you act, and how you perceive things differently than those around you.

For example, when I moved to Colombia, I could no longer rely on how things were in my home country. Instead, I had to analyze the culture shock especially of how people interact differently from what I was used to.

You may realize how certain beliefs you had before are no longer valid in the new environment, how you had certain expectations that led to disappointment, how your identity is shaped by where you come from, and how living abroad changes how you think. It can also help you to create a more positive outlook on life as well as gain an appreciation of different cultures.

Furthermore, this experience will help you to become more independent and confident in your decisions, as you are the only one responsible for how things turn out. You will learn how to trust finding yourself and how to be comfortable with being different from those around you.

In short, living abroad is a great way to develop self-awareness, find yourself, and falling in love with yourself even more!

9. Shapes your future and goals

Living abroad can be one of the most transformative experiences you will ever have. You come away from it with a greater understanding of how different cultures operate and how your own culture functions in comparison.

This increased knowledge can help shape your future and goals, as it provides more clarity about what is important to you and how best to pursue your dreams.

When you move abroad and live in a completely different country, you are exposed to a range of different lifestyles, and how other people tackle their everyday problems.

This can help you to realize how certain elements in your own life may be holding you back or how small changes could lead to improved results.

The opportunities that come with living abroad will give you the chance to refine your skills, explore new interests, and learn how to take advantage of any given situation.

This will help you develop your self-awareness, which is necessary for setting goals and achieving success.

So don’t hesitate – seize the opportunity, explore the world and see how much it could change you if you decide to move abroad!

10. Discover your own strength and tenacity

You’re encouraged to explore a lot of new things abroad, and with it you are going to discover your own strength and tenacity. This will be an excellent opportunity for you to grow and develop as a person.

From navigating the language and bureaucracy of a new country to finding employment, there are all sorts of challenges you have to face up to.

These will help you build resilience and inner strength that is hard to gain in familiar surroundings.

Living abroad also teaches you how to handle difficult situations, how to be resourceful, how to trust yourself for decisions made, and how to be aware of the thoughts that come into your mind and process them in a mature way.

11. Become more culturally aware

My experience moving to South America helped me to break down cultural barriers.

Living in a new place helps you become more aware of the different cultures in the area.

It’s indeed an opportunity for cultural exchange and understanding. You can learn how to better empathize with those who have different backgrounds, beliefs, and values.

This is an invaluable experience that helps you become more aware of how culture can shape how people perceive the world.

And believe me, it’s something you are going to carry back home with you forever!

12. Find your real friends

Distance makes you realize who your real friends are.

Taking some time away from someone can help you to assess your feelings for them and determine whether or not they are truly bringing fulfillment into your life.

Ultimately, it may make you appreciate how much you value their presence in your life – or alternatively, the peace that comes with being apart.

With that said, as an avid globetrotter, I never found it difficult to maintain relationships while traveling.

Over the course of my journeys, some friends have come and gone but I’m forever grateful for everything they’ve taught me during our time together.

13. Become more empathetic

Living abroad helps you to become more empathetic.

You will be exposed to many experiences – which often require you to see things from a different perspective.

Your understanding of how other people live and how they view the world is broadened by living abroad.

When you open your mind to how other cultures think and how they act, you begin to develop a deeper understanding of how your actions might affect people.

It also helps you appreciate how different life experiences shape how people interpret the world.

Moving to South America was an eye-opening experience that allowed me to gain a greater understanding of the local culture and how people deal with various challenges. Witnessing first-hand their everyday decisions, beliefs, and lifestyle gave me insight into life from another perspective.

For instance, I had the privilege to recognize and appreciate the true worth of USD 100$, which is a typical amount for someone like me who hails from Europe or North America. But not for someone from Latin America, I especially gained so much empathis when I a Colombian friend of mine was facing financial struggles. By showing genuine understanding and empathy, I was able to gain a better understanding of their reality without judgement. This experience resonated with me, and strengthened my appreciation for the power of empathy in connecting with others.

As long as you are willing to be open-minded, living abroad for a year can truly help build empathy. It is an eye-opening experience that can help you be more understanding and compassionate toward other people’s perspectives. And it is a truly invaluable gift!

14. Build confidence

Being far from home, far from the comfort of your house, lets you build up a confidence that makes you feel as if you have superpowers.

If someone asked me ‘how living abroad changes you after a year?’, I’d say it completely broadens your perspective and understanding of the world. It teaches you to be open-minded and accepting, while also teaching you to appreciate different cultures and ways of life.

And I truly understood it once when I was coming home from Cartagena, Colombia, I knew what I wanted and I was confident that I would get it! Before that, I was a completely lost puppy that had no idea of what to do with my life.

Once you build up your self-confidence and become more independent, you can take on bigger risks, try new things and face your fears.

You truly become a citizen of the world, with more knowledge and appreciation of the diversity that exists in our world.

15. Learn new skills

Investing in yourself by honing new skills is essential if you want to thrive!

Living abroad will boost your skills in many areas, such as how to cook a meal with limited resources, how to fix something around the house without help, how to maintain a budget, and how to plan for future events.

You may even learn how to speak a new language, pick up some new hobbies, and how to navigate around a completely different city!

Overall, living abroad for a year (or for a lifetime) will help you become a more mature and independent individual as you take on new challenges that are unique to your current situation.

You’ll gain valuable skills, open-mindedness, and an appreciation for the world that can only come from experiencing it first-hand.

My Experience Moving Abroad

At the age of 23, I decided to take a leap of faith and move abroad. I didn’t go to study abroad, but little did I know that this would have been the best learning experience of my entire life.

Growing up in Switzerland provided me with an abundance of opportunities and security! But, it was like my heart yearned for something more.

I wanted to explore new places, learn how different cultures lived, and experience new ways of life. That’s why I made the decision to move to Cartagena, Colombia – a beautiful city with a vibrant culture and stunning beaches.

I understand people’s worries about safety, but it isn’t as bad as Hollywood usually makes out.

Colombia is generally safe to visit; in fact, its security measures are on par with those of the United States!

That said, there are certain areas that require extra caution, as with anywhere in the world.

Moving abroad to Latin America was both exhilarating and terrifying. On one hand, I was excited by the adventure that lay ahead of me; on the other, it felt like I was leaving behind everything I knew and loved.

But as soon as I arrived in Cartagena, all my worries melted away.

The city was full of life and energy, and the people were so friendly and welcoming. It didn’t take long before I felt like I belonged there!

Fun fact? I was born in Switzerland, but my dark complexion and brown eyes could make me blend right into a South American crowd. It’s almost like having two passports at once! My natural beauty gives the perfect illusion that I’m from somewhere far south of here.

That could be why I felt so connected and welcomed to the place.

Living abroad has had a tremendous impact on how I view the world. My experiences allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how different cultures think and how they approach life.

I was able to learn how to navigate a new city and how to live with less.

My Spanish has also improved drastically, as I’ve had plenty of opportunities to practice (yay, another language in my pocket!).

Most importantly, living abroad has allowed me to grow as a person. I’ve come out of my comfort zone and explored how I want to live, how I want to think, how I want to approach life, and how I want to interact with people. The confidence that I’ve gained from this experience is immense – it’s like having a superpower!

The idea of returning home was the last thing I wanted to do. However, I mustered up the courage and stepped back into my home country. It’s amazing how one decision can change your life so drastically!

Overall, living abroad has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. It has allowed me to learn how to navigate new situations, how to find joy in the small things, and how to live a life of adventure and exploration every single day.

If you’re on the fence about taking the plunge, just do it – you won’t regret it!
