Title: Crossroads: A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore — Hello! Singapore Tours

"Baker's thrilling book profits from his refusal to separate Singapore's history from Malaysia's. What we get is a broad story filled with surprising details drawn from his own experiences and from other scholarly works, and told in an easy and captivating style."

— Dr Ooi Kee Beng, Fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore



"Jim Baker's Crossroads is bound to raise more than a few eyebrows in more than a few quarters. His book presents a side of history not many may be aware of or even want to know ... it is as thought-provoking as it is enlightening."
