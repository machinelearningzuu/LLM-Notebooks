Title: Singapore Scarves by Binary Style — Hello! Singapore Tours

A pair of twin sisters founded the local boutique brand in 2015. As trained architects with a keen eye for design, the duo choose to set up Binary Style as a means of distilling key elements of Singapore’s architecture and weaving it with local patterns, shapes, and colors to tell a captivating tale. Primarily inspired by Singapore’s culture, heritage, urban life, and nature, Binary Style uses its collection of over 60 beautiful scarves as a medium to illustrate and narrate Singapore’s story–be it from the past or present. These scarves are made of either cotton, silk, cotton silk or chiffon, making them classic and comfortable pieces to wear and own.
