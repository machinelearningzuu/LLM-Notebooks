Title: Food tours after dark

One of the best ways to experience a place is by tasting its food. Get to know the island a little better by taking to the streets and uncovering some tantalising local cuisine—sign up for food tours that will take you from East to West, spanning the wet markets and Malay quarters. Better still, embark on your journey after hours and enjoy some beautiful views of the city at night. Here are some night food tours to look forward to.

Joo Chiat/Katong Food Walk

Tour operator: Betel Box Asia

This one is for the avid foodies craving diverse flavours. With the highest number of local dishes to be sampled as part of a tour—a whopping 30 to 40—your taste buds will be wholly satisfied. Taste local delights such as the aromatic fish head curry (an Indian favourite) or the iconic chilli crab from various restaurants, coffee shops and eateries. These are located along heritage-rich Joo Chiat Complex, Joo Chiat Place, Haig Road and Ceylon Road. The area is a hotbed of Peranakan* culture, with traditional shophouses and hip boutiques to shop at. The tour is led by Betel Box, which also runs a hostel in the area–don’t be shy about asking them for some insider travel tips! *The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.
