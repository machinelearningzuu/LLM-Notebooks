Title: A 2-day guide for aspiring artists

“I love Tiong Bahru because it’s a mix of the old and new world,” Jahan shares. To fully experience Tiong Bahru’s charm, start at Tiong Bahru Market & Food Centre with breakfast on the second floor and a stroll through the fresh produce section on the first.

At the other end of the street, past the various cafes and independent art gallery DegiosArt, is the Qi Tian Gong Temple—the first temple in Singapore that’s dedicated to the Buddhist Monkey God. Devotees come from all over the world to offer incense and prayers.

Venture further southwest into the neighbourhood to join new-age hipsters in their hunt for vinyl and handcrafted curios at independent local stores like Curated Records. As Jahan puts it, “Tiong Bahru is hip without being too gentrified.”
