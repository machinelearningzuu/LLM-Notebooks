Title: Uncover Singapore’s hidden stories with Cai Yinzhou

Meet

Yinzhou

URBAN EXPLORER, TOUR GUIDE

Since the days of his youth—many of which were spent exploring the streets of Geylang—Cai Yinzhou has had an impulse for discovering hidden stories. To this young, compassionate tour guide, old buildings are filled with lessons from the past, and neighbourhoods are classrooms where personal narratives entwine with the arc of history.

Yinzhou’s many social initiatives include Geylang Adventures—which aims to unpack social issues through sight-seeing—and Back Alley Barbers, a project offering free haircuts to migrant labourers. For his efforts in aiding Singapore’s disadvantaged, the young advocate of social change was conferred the Singapore Youth Award in 2017.
