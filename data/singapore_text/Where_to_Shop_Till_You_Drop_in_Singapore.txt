Title: Where to Shop Till You Drop in Singapore

Where

Collectors

meet

In Singapore, shopping is not just about buying things: it’s exploring different worlds where retail, nature, tech and heritage meet. Cruise into Funan Mall on a bicycle. Browse shops around a rain vortex in Jewel Changi. Indulge in luxury brands at international flagship stores along Orchard Road. Take home cultural memorabilia at our ethnic enclaves; or get involved in craft workshops by independent brands. There’s a surprise around the corner for every kind of collector.
