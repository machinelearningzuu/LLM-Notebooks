Title: Activities for night owls in Singapore

Our city never sleeps, and you don’t have to either. Singapore offers myriad activities you can indulge in around the clock, from bars that hearken back to the 1920s to late night supper spots.

Whether you’re looking to amp up the party vibes or wind down with a sauna session, here are eight activities to indulge in after dark.

Unwind with relaxing activities

If you’re feeling fatigued from a long-haul flight or frazzled from a hectic business trip, be sure to drop by g.spa. Open 24/7, the establishment is perfect for a dose of late-night respite, with its steam baths, saunas and hot and cold pools.

Besides its stellar facilities, the spa offers a range of treatments to indulge in, including deep tissue body massages, foot reflexology and facials.

If you’re visiting the branch at Tebing Lane, be sure to pair your late-night prawning session with a cold beer or three from the establishment’s Banyan Beer Garden, a specially curated alfresco bar and restaurant.

Savour late-night supper

Swee Choon Tim Sum With a history that stretches all the way back to 1962, Swee Choon Tim Sum is more than just an eatery—it’s an institution. A beloved haunt of local foodies looking for an after-midnight supper fix, this charming establishment along Jalan Besar boasts a whole range of traditional dim sum (bite-sized portions of food, served in steamer baskets and small plates). For first-timers, half the fun is in discovering new flavours, and sharing them with your supper buddies, but we do recommend trying out their red bean paste pancakes and xiao long bao (soup dumplings).

Fengshan Hawker Centre

Colloquially known as ‘Bedok 85’, Fengshan Hawker Centre is one of the hottest supper spots on the island. You’ll find it bustling with life even in the middle of the night, as Singaporeans gather to feast on local hawker fare with friends and family.

A must-try dish here is the bak chor mee (minced pork noodles), which you can find at the neighbouring stalls of Seng Hiang Bak Chor Mee (#01-08) and Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian (#01-07).

Locals have gotten into passionate debates about which of these hawkers whips up the superior dish, and you may want to order from both stalls to see if you have a preference.
