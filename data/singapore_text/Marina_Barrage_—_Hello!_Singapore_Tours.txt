Title: Marina Barrage — Hello! Singapore Tours

Built across the Marina Channel, the Marina Barrage is Singapore’s 15th reservoir. It acts as a flood control measure for low-lying parts of the city centre by keeping out the tidal influence. Its stable water surface makes it an ideal venue for water and recreational activities and visitors can also enjoy a picnic and kite flying against the stunning city skyline at the barrage’s Green Roof.

It is a showpiece of environmental sustainability where green principles are applied in the design, construction and operation of the barrage. Pay a visit to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (SSG), housed in Marina Barrage, to learn about Singapore’s sustainability measures.
