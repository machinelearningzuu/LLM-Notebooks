Title: Singapore Art Week Events 2023

As Singapore’s signature visual arts season, Singapore Art Week (SAW) represents the unity and pride of a diverse and vibrant arts community in Singapore.

From 6 to 15 January 2023, SAW 2023 will present an array of over 130 art events featuring new works and transnational collaborations across the island and online.

In its 11th edition, the ten-day celebration of the visual arts will showcase two dynamic art fairs, S.E.A. Focus and the inaugural ART SG; as well as the Singapore Biennale and a vibrant Light to Night in the Civic District.

SAW is a nexus for creative collaborations and audiences can look forward to an exciting line-up of art experiences at our museums, galleries, independent art spaces and public spaces, and enjoy enriching discussions, talks, walks and tours.



Whether you’re participating from overseas or visiting the shores of our sunny island, you’re bound to be enthralled by inspiring events and art in unexpected places, from tours to enlightening discussions and talks with renowned artists.



Take a jaunt through the colourful streets of Little India and Katong-Joo Chiat, experience Art After Dark at Gillman Barracks and explore contemporary art in the district of Tanjong Pagar.
