Title: Must Try Water Sports Activities in Singapore

With an endless summer all year round, Singapore’s tropical climate makes it a great place to indulge in a dose of sun, sand and surf.

From windsurfing to water-propelling jet blades, there are boundless water sports to immerse yourself in that will test your limits and hone both your skills and courage. Here’s a list of what we’d recommend for thrill-seekers in Singapore.

Thrills and spills at Wild Wild Wet

Wild Wild Wet is one of Singapore’s largest water theme parks, with a mix of rides and attractions that are certain to thrill adrenaline junkies and their families. Established in 2004, the park has since been expanded to nearly double its original size. There are rides and attractions for both adults and kids to enjoy, but we recommend testing the waters at Ular-Lah, the first raft slide in Southeast Asia and a super flume experience that’s bound to push the limits of your courage. Parents with younger children should take note that there may be height safety requirements on various rides. Downtown East. 1 Pasir Ris Close, Singapore 519599. +65 6581 9128.

Canoeing at Singapore Sports Hub

Located next to the Kallang Basin, Singapore Sports Hub combines world-class sporting infrastructure with community lifestyle and entertainment facilities. Beginners and children looking to get their feet wet should sign up for a kayak orientation programme, while more experienced canoers and kayakers can try their hand at more advanced classes like the Kayak 2 Star Personal Skill Award. If you’d rather have an unguided experience, canoes and kayaks are also available for rent at the Water Sports Centre.

Jet Blading at Ola Beach Club

Aside from being an exhilarating experience, jet blading will test your agility and help you hone your balance.
