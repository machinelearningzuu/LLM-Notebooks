Title: Discover Singaporean craftsmanship via atelier owners

Meet

James and Winnie



FOUNDERS OF BYND ARTISAN, CRAFT ATELIER

Meet James Quan and Winnie Chan, the husband-wife duo behind Bynd Artisan. Founded in 2014, their ateliers are an experiential retail concept that personalises paper and leather goods and is built upon the legacy of Winnie’s grandfather, who established Singapore’s oldest bookbindery in the 1940s.

More than just a space selling personalised stationery, Bynd Artisan has created a community of craftsmen and artisanal collaborators. They’ve done so through creating unique, immersive experiences within their ateliers and engaging in creative collaborations with Singaporean artistic talents like Erwin Lian and homegrown designer Larry Peh.

With five established stores across the island, this tireless couple aspires to make Bynd Artisan an iconic Singapore brand.
