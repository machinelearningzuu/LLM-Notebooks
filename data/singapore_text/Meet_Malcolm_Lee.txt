Title: Meet Malcolm Lee

Meet

Malcolm

Michelin-starred chef

One of a select handful of Singaporean chefs to have won a Michelin Star—which he has retained since 2016—Malcolm is constantly looking for ways to both preserve and innovate the flavours of his youth. As a child, he grew up with the smell of spices from his grandmother’s traditional Peranakan dishes wafting through his doorway.

When Malcolm realised that life chained to a desk wasn’t for him, he turned his lifelong passion for food into a career in the kitchen. Upon securing a Miele-Guide At-Sunrice scholarship and graduating from the At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy, he worked his way from humble line cook to his current role as chef-owner of Peranakan restaurant Candlenut.
