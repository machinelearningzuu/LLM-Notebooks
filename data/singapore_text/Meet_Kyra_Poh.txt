Title: Meet Kyra Poh

Inspired by

boundless potential

“My dream was to become an astronaut, because I thought that was the only way I could fly,” Kyra shares. It was her dream of flying—and the limitless potential of indoor skydiving—that first captured eight-year-old Kyra’s attention. “There’s no end to what you can learn with indoor skydiving. It’s like a combination of many sports.” The fearless flyer hopes to expand her horizons, and to experience all that her sport can offer: “My dream is to be able to travel to all the different tunnels around the world. There are over 100 of them!”
