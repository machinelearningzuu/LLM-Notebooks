Title: Mount Faber Park

It’s possible to drive up to Mount Faber, Singapore’s second highest hill, but that would deprive you of experiencing one of the most popular attractions in the country.

Singapore’s cable car system links Mount Faber to Sentosa Island, and is a fantastic way to both see the island and reach the dining and entertainment complex that occupies its peak.

Originally named Telok Blangah Hill, it was renamed Mount Faber in July 1845, in honour of Captain Charles Edward Faber of the Madras Engineers, who built a narrow winding road to the summit for the installation of a signal station.

In 2005, the cable car station atop Mount Faber was transformed into the tourist destination known as Faber Peak, where you can have a drink at trendy bars and restaurants while enjoying some of the best views in the country. Grab a cocktail and pick from a menu of sumptuous Western fare at Dusk Restaurant and Bar, or partake in a locally-inspired meal in the comfort of a cable car cabin, as you pass serenely over the night lights of the city far below.

It’s a unique way to spend a romantic evening with a loved one, or a captivating experience for the whole family.
