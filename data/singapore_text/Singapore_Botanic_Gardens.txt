Title: Singapore Botanic Gardens

A testament to Singapore’s reputation as a City in a Garden, the Botanic Gardens is the country’s first UNESCO Heritage Site.



Established in 1859 by the Agri-Horticultural Society, 60 acres of land were transformed from a disused plantation into the popular recreational garden you see today.



As well as being a favourite recreation venue for jogging, dining or just lazing about, the sprawling grounds are also a leading centre for botanical and horticultural research.



Highlights include The National Orchid Garden, which boasts the world’s largest orchid display, with over 60,000 plants and orchid plants.



Meanwhile, the SBG Heritage Museum features interactive and multimedia exhibits and panels that detail the Gardens' rich heritage, while the CDL Green Gallery displays botanical-related exhibits.

Kids will have a blast at the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden where they can play and learn all about plant life. A host of restaurants and cafes are also available to satisfy thirsty and hungry visitors after a day out in the sun.

And once you’re ready to step back into the concrete jungle, the Orchard Road shopping district is mere minutes away.
