that investments in the supply chain sector remain robust, Pando, a startup developing fulfillment management technologies, today announced that it raised $30 million in a Series B round, bringing its total raised to $45 million.\n\nIron Pillar and Uncorrelated Ventures led the round, with participation from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners, Chiratae Ventures and Next47. CEO and founder Nitin Jayakrishnan says that the new capital will be put toward expanding Pando\u2019s global sales, marketing and delivery capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe will not expand into new industries or adjacent product areas,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cGreat talent is the foundation of the business \u2014 we will continue to augment our teams at all levels of the organization. Pando is also open to exploring strategic partnerships and acquisitions with this round of funding.\u201d\n\nPando was co-launched by Jayakrishnan and Abhijeet Manohar, who previously worked together at iDelivery, an India-based freight tech marketplace \u2014 and their first startup. The two saw firsthand manufacturers, distributors and retailers were struggling with legacy tech and point solutions to understand, optimize and manage their global logistics operations \u2014 or at least, that\u2019s the story Jayakrishnan tells.\n\n\u201cSupply chain leaders were trying to build their own tech and throwing people at the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis caught our attention \u2014 we spent months talking to and building for enterprise users at warehouses, factories, freight yards and ports and eventually, in 2018, decided to start Pando to solve for global logistics through a software-as-a-service platform offering.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s truth to what Jayakrishnan\u2019s expressing about pent-up demand. According to a recent McKinsey survey, supply chain companies had \u2014 and have \u2014 a strong desire for tools that deliver greater supply chain visibility. Sixty-seven percent of respondents to the survey say that they\u2019ve implemented dashboards for this purpose, while over half say that they\u2019re investing in supply chain visibility services more broadly.\n\nPando aims to meet the need by consolidating supply chain data that resides in multiple silos within and outside of the enterprise, including data on customers, suppliers, logistics service providers, facilities and product SKUs. The platform provides various tools and apps for accomplishing different tasks across freight procurement, trade and transport management, freight audit and payment and document management, as well as dispatch planning and analytics.\n\nCustomers can customize the tools and apps or build their own using Pando\u2019s APIs. This, along with the platform\u2019s emphasis on no-code capabilities, differentiates Pando from incumbents like SAP, Oracle, Blue Yonder and E2Open, Jayakrishnan asserts.\n\n\u201cPando comes pre-integrated with leading enterprise resource planning (ERPs) systems and has ready APIs and a professional services team to integrate with any new ERPs and enterprise systems,\u201d he added. \u201cPando\u2019s no-code capabilities enable business users to customize the apps while maintaining platform integrity \u2014 reducing the need for IT resources for each customization.\u201d\n\nPando also taps algorithms and forms of machine learning to make predictions around supply chain events. For example, the platform attempts to match customer orders with suppliers, customers through the \u201cright\u201d channel (in terms of aspects like cost and carbon footprint) and fulfillment strategy (e.g. mode of freight, carrier, etc.). Beyond this, Pando can detect anomalies among deliveries, orders and freight invoices and anticipate supply chain risk given demand and supply trends.\n\nPando isn\u2019t the only vendor doing this. Altana, which bagged $100 million in venture capital last October, uses an AI system to connect to and learn from logistics and business-to-business data \u2014 creating a shared view of supply chain networks. Everstream, another Pando rival, offers its own dashboards for data analysis, integrated with existing ERP, transportation management and supplier relationship management systems.\n\nBut Pando has a compelling sales pitch, judging by its momentum. The company counts Fortune 500 manufacturers and retailers \u2014 including P&G, J&J, Valvoline, Castrol, Cummins, Siemens, Danaher and Accuride \u2014 among its customer base. Since the startup\u2019s Series A in 2020, revenue has grown 8x while the number of customers has increased 5x, Jayakrishnan said.\n\nAsked whether he expects expansion to continue well into the future, given the signs of potential trouble on the horizon, Jayakrishnan seemed fairly optimistic. He pointed to a Deloitte survey that found that more than 70% of manufacturing companies have been impacted by supply chain disruptions in the past year, with 90% of those companies experiencing increased costs and declining productivity.\n\nThe result of those major disruptions?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4888, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8a637e4-fee5-4d91-a234-178a500200ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8a637e4-fee5-4d91-a234-178a500200ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-ai-powered-supply-chain-startup-pando-lands-30m-investment.txt", "file_name": "05-03-ai-powered-supply-chain-startup-pando-lands-30m-investment.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5678, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0fabb8f2-af0b-4fe3-be5b-3b5f182adba1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-ai-powered-supply-chain-startup-pando-lands-30m-investment.txt", "file_name": "05-03-ai-powered-supply-chain-startup-pando-lands-30m-investment.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5678, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "99d4c0a002ecfaecb520d2f875b858a511c9d835d3025118d60d17e68ab68ed4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b812b01-0c95-4883-b1d3-f73ec82b98cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-ai-powered-supply-chain-startup-pando-lands-30m-investment.txt", "file_name": "05-03-ai-powered-supply-chain-startup-pando-lands-30m-investment.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5678, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "a4d2321640c9dd2052a253d23d434d2274595d3d745094c64f3f6dcc9fcdba5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "129ea76d-bb8d-4d0f-ba29-29c9884a632b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e45fd77d4b88f3c6834d13aa09101f9264ef3a541bfe59b79cd88b12842d2a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e29abe1d97c452788676de75bbef1b601ecb2472ba73f073e7cec00d5ac2fe96", "text": "But Pando has a compelling sales pitch, judging by its momentum.

As the scene opens, he takes a seat and declares: \u201cWho will be the successor? Me.\u201d\n\nOf course, that scene didn\u2019t appear on HBO\u2019s hit show, but it\u2019s a good illustration of generative AI\u2019s level of sophistication compared to the real thing. Yet as the Writers Guild of America goes on strike in pursuit of livable working conditions and better streaming residuals, the networks won\u2019t budge on writers\u2019 demands to regulate the use of AI in writers\u2019 rooms.\n\n\u201cOur proposal is that we not be required to adapt something that\u2019s output by AI, and that the output of an AI not be considered writers\u2019 work,\u201d comedy writer Adam Conover told TechCrunch. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t entirely exclude that technology from the production process, but it does mean that our working conditions wouldn\u2019t be undermined by AI.\u201d\n\nBut the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) refused to engage with that proposal, instead offering a yearly meeting to discuss \u201cadvances in technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we first put [the proposal] in, we thought we were covering our bases \u2014 you know, some of our members are worried about this, the area is moving quickly, we should get ahead of it,\u201d Conover said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be a contentious issue because the fact of the matter is, the current state of the text-generation technology is completely incapable of writing any work that could be used in a production.\u201d\n\nThe text-generating algorithms behind tools like ChatGPT are not built to entertain us. Instead, they analyze patterns in massive datasets to respond to requests by determining what is most likely the desired output. So, ChatGPT knows that \u201cSuccession\u201d is about an aging media magnate\u2019s children fighting for control of his company, but it is unlikely to come up with any dialogue more nuanced than, \u201cWho will be the successor? Me.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ben Zhao, a University of Chicago professor and faculty lead of art anti-mimicry tool Glaze, AI advancements can be used as an excuse for corporations to devalue human labor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to the advantage of the studios and bigger corporations to basically over-claim ChatGPT\u2019s abilities, so they can, in negotiations at least, undermine and minimize the role of human creatives,\u201d Zhao told TechCrunch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how many people at these larger companies actually believe what they\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nConover emphasized that some parts of a writer\u2019s job are less obvious than literal scriptwriting but equally difficult to replicate with AI.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going and meeting with the set decoration department that says, \u2018Hey, we can\u2019t actually build this prop that you\u2019re envisioning, could you do this instead?\u2019 and then you talk to them and go back and rewrite,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a human enterprise that involves working with other people, and that simply cannot be done by an AI.\u201d\n\nComedian Yedoye Travis sees how AI could be useful in a writers\u2019 room.\n\n\u201cWhat we do in writers\u2019 rooms is ultimately bouncing ideas around,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not good per se, an AI can throw together a script in however many minutes, compared to a week for human writers, and then it\u2019s easier to edit than to write.\u201d\n\nBut even if there may be some promise for how humans can leverage this technology, he worries that studios see it merely as a way to demand more from writers over a shorter period of time.\n\n\u201cIt says to me that they\u2019re only concerned with things being made,\u201d Travis said. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned with people being paid for things being made.\u201d\n\nWriters are also advocating to regulate the use of AI in entertainment because it remains a legal grey area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the work that it outputs is copyrightable, and a movie studio is not going to spend $50 to $100 million shooting a script that they don\u2019t know that they own the copyright to,\u201d Conover said. \u201cSo we figured this would be an easy give for [the AMPTP], but they completely stonewalled on it.\u201d\n\nAs the Writers Guild of America strikes for the first time since its historic 100-day action in 2007, Conover said he thinks the debate over AI technology is a \u201cred herring.\u201d With generative AI in such a rudimentary stage, writers are more immediately concerned with dismal streaming residuals and understaffed writing teams. Yet studios\u2019 pushback on the union\u2019s AI-related requests only further reinforces the core issue: The people who power Hollywood aren\u2019t being paid their fair share.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the technology,\u201d Conover said.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4552, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "934c3800-58ee-402c-b456-d6c12b5f517d": {"__data__": {"id_": "934c3800-58ee-402c-b456-d6c12b5f517d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-ai-replace-tv-writers-strike.txt", "file_name": "05-03-ai-replace-tv-writers-strike.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4836, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3592660b-89a1-438c-be7a-c52c90e23070", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-ai-replace-tv-writers-strike.txt", "file_name": "05-03-ai-replace-tv-writers-strike.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4836, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "b3b07e93185c893a776a3e590eb70f5188e5788ecd535dc65accdfa121a4d62a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "129ea76d-bb8d-4d0f-ba29-29c9884a632b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-ai-replace-tv-writers-strike.txt", "file_name": "05-03-ai-replace-tv-writers-strike.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4836, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "6e45fd77d4b88f3c6834d13aa09101f9264ef3a541bfe59b79cd88b12842d2a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6e51e31-ad06-4192-8eda-0adc25a8e731", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1bcd0dfc6cfb17f8f714a498f5eab8ba932f9395d1acdb8b1be3e2561976bee7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "df06102f84d00a2a175b3d32bc764df6f3b47b3dfb9aaf0d4b8538c5a5cedd8e", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the work that it outputs is copyrightable, and a movie studio is not going to spend $50 to $100 million shooting a script that they don\u2019t know that they own the copyright to,\u201d Conover said. \u201cSo we figured this would be an easy give for [the AMPTP], but they completely stonewalled on it.\u201d\n\nAs the Writers Guild of America strikes for the first time since its historic 100-day action in 2007, Conover said he thinks the debate over AI technology is a \u201cred herring.\u201d With generative AI in such a rudimentary stage, writers are more immediately concerned with dismal streaming residuals and understaffed writing teams.

It\u2019s able to write essays, code and more given short text prompts, hyper-charging productivity. But it also has a more\u2026nefarious side.\n\nIn any case, AI tools are not going away \u2014 and indeed has expanded dramatically since its launch just a few months ago. Major brands are experimenting with it, using the AI to generate ad and marketing copy, for example.\n\nAnd OpenAI is heavily investing in it. ChatGPT was recently super-charged by GPT-4, the latest language-writing model from OpenAI\u2019s labs. Paying ChatGPT users have access to GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than the model that previously powered ChatGPT. In addition to GPT-4, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet with plugins available in alpha to users and developers on the waitlist.\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, to be updated regularly. We also answer the most common FAQs (see below).\n\nTimeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates\n\nMay 3, 2023\n\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms.The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\n\nApril 25, 2023\n\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\n\nApril 24, 2023\n\nOpenAI applied for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\n\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\n\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\n\nApril 22, 2023\n\nAuto-GPT is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\n\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\n\nApril 18, 2023\n\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4249, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92cc7c8a-ab74-42d4-889a-8fc920ee2223": {"__data__": {"id_": "92cc7c8a-ab74-42d4-889a-8fc920ee2223", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_name": "05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 18062, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aeefdd19-0925-4a3a-89cb-110bf2ecde41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_name": "05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 18062, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "e84ed5a0cc2baa6939ee98526261ac30c5c06e08b18b93c8ad4e20f4b7ed6a25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6e51e31-ad06-4192-8eda-0adc25a8e731", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_name": "05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 18062, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "1bcd0dfc6cfb17f8f714a498f5eab8ba932f9395d1acdb8b1be3e2561976bee7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6306ba91-4d2e-4a2b-b5f6-9ed34e11fab1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c550d76444b632ec5b51ac94cdd02fd699ad558fcf74976a621bdea036f4bd8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aff2d3b1a795b061843a0b5c778ffa933707968efa8b0630b94e2e4452f8cd5b", "text": "April 22, 2023\n\nAuto-GPT is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\n\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways.

However, what makes the app different from the default ChatGPT experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\n\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having ChatGPT pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\n\nThe research was conducted using the latest version of ChatGPT, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\n\nApril 4, 2023\n\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\n\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\n\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\n\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\n\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\n\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect.

The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bots functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.\n\nMarch 14, 2023\n\nGPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.\n\nIs ChatGPT free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nThere is not an app available for iPhone or Android, but users have options to enable the chatbot on their mobile devices via their browser or a third-party app that uses ChatGPT\u2019s public API.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form.", "start_char_idx": 10629, "end_char_idx": 14868, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f01b446c-baa8-472a-8fe5-88f4753a54ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "f01b446c-baa8-472a-8fe5-88f4753a54ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_name": "05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 18062, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aeefdd19-0925-4a3a-89cb-110bf2ecde41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_name": "05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 18062, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "e84ed5a0cc2baa6939ee98526261ac30c5c06e08b18b93c8ad4e20f4b7ed6a25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad2d7855-53e3-492d-ae06-4cd213bd4b6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_name": "05-03-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-powered-chatbot.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 18062, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "bb333f9fab897f8d97ed93b348cd3788e37b248cd1ae92236ccd670a90721c82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b1bf0ac-f307-4d22-866f-98fc3edc1d33", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8050c6555a53154f0f88336cbb70d448d1416083fdcd35747ab32963b94206ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "04ae64aef4819f33bf0b2242b62290891dc0690fb1bf4d30ad9f14cbe6f43576", "text": "That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes.

This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly.

Checks, an AI-powered tool to check mobile apps for compliance with various privacy rules and regulations, is moving into Google proper as a privacy product aimed at mobile developers.\n\nChecks originally made its debut in February 2022, although it was in development for some time before that. In its time at Area 120, it became one of the largest projects in the group, co-founders Fergus Hurley and Nia Castelly told me, with 10 people fully dedicated to it and a number of others contributing less formally. The founders\u2019 job titles under Google will now be GM and Legal Lead, respectively, for Checks.\n\nThe amount that Google invested in the project was never disclosed, nor was the valuation of the exit to the parent company from the incubator, but the company has confirmed that there was a valuation and that it had grown since launch.\n\nThe company is not disclosing how many customers it has in total but notes that they are in the sectors of gaming, health, finance, education and retail. A sampling includes Miniclip, Rovio, Kongregate, Crayola and Yousician and in total the number of customers represented by its customers is over 3 billion.\n\nChecks will sit in the Developer X division. \u201cWhat Fergus, Nia, and the entire Google Checks team have accomplished is one of the hardest things to do. Their focus on customer needs and nimble execution has served them well, and we\u2019re eager to push ahead in this next phase of Checks,\u201d said Jeanine Banks in a statement.\n\nChecks is one of those ideas that feels incredibly timely in that it speaks to an issue that\u2019s growing in importance for consumers \u2014 who will vote with their feet when they feel that their privacy is in jeopardy. That in turn also puts more pressure on developers to get things right on the privacy front. App publishers these days are faced with a growing array of rules and regulations around data protection and privacy, not just rules like GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California (and the U.S.) set across different countries and jurisdictions, but also by companies that operate platforms within their own compliance efforts.\n\nWhen translated into how those regulations impact apps, there are potential issues at the front end, as well as on the back end, with how apps are coded and information moves from one place to another to consider. It\u2019s a spaghetti bowl of issues, with fixes in one area potentially impacting another and making user experience less smooth to boot.\n\nChecks leans on artificial intelligence and machine learning to scan apps and their code to identify areas where there might be violations of privacy and data protection rules, and provides remediation to suggest how to fix it \u2014 tasks that would be far more difficult for a team of humans to execute on their own. It\u2019s already integrated with Google\u2019s large language models and what it describes as \u201capp understanding technologies\u201d to power what it identifies and make suggestions for fixing issues.\n\nA dashboard lets users monitor and triage issues in the areas of compliance monitoring, data monitoring and store disclosure support (which is focused specifically on Google Play data safety). With the service also aimed at iOS developers, it\u2019s not clear if it will add Apple App Store data safety at any point into that mix. All of this can be monitored in real time on live apps, as well as when they are still in development.\n\nWe have reached out to Google to get an update on the status of the other two projects that were spared all-out closure after Area 120 changed focus. They include video dubbing solution Aloud and an as-yet unnamed consumer product from the team that had previously built a bookmarking app Liist (which got acquired by Google).\n\nAs of right now, Liist\u2019s co-founder David Friedl still describes himself on LinkedIn as working on a stealth product at Area 120, and Aloud is still using an Area 120 URL, so it seems that they remain in a holding pattern. (We\u2019ll update this if and when we hear more.)\n\nIn the meantime, Area 120 itself is also seeing some revolving doors. Clay Bavor, who was running Area 120 among other things and who messaged the big changes to staff in January, was out the door just a month later. He has now teamed up with Bret Taylor \u2014 another ex-Googler who has an outsized track record that includes being the CTO of Facebook and the co-CEO of Salesforce \u2014 to work on a mystery startup.\n\nUpdated with more information about Checks\u2019 valuation and quote from Google.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4710, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d83f5aeb-a49d-40ba-8871-7903f90890fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "d83f5aeb-a49d-40ba-8871-7903f90890fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-databricks-acquires-ai-centric-data-governance-platform-okera.txt", "file_name": "05-03-databricks-acquires-ai-centric-data-governance-platform-okera.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3281, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2bc114f6-4b48-417b-9e25-d85993873e7e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-databricks-acquires-ai-centric-data-governance-platform-okera.txt", "file_name": "05-03-databricks-acquires-ai-centric-data-governance-platform-okera.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3281, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "650bb9f92192998a2aa578c65bcb2a9676699a726406ae27f534e39bf0dce2db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b1bf0ac-f307-4d22-866f-98fc3edc1d33", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-checks-the-ai-powered-data-protection-project-incubated-in-area-120-officially-exits-to-google.txt", "file_name": "05-03-checks-the-ai-powered-data-protection-project-incubated-in-area-120-officially-exits-to-google.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4750, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "8050c6555a53154f0f88336cbb70d448d1416083fdcd35747ab32963b94206ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4e99397-6bb5-433a-8cc4-910d6cc14f34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d794d1a654b001cd6b5256535fba821c2d5c2b2e1a3c111817d5c4ea0dde401a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3dcca8e1140b81913a1591bc217c77bae5d9940dd0dcca267a9b22e8ce7b1f7c", "text": "Databricks today announced that it has acquired Okera, a data governance platform with a focus on AI. The two companies did not disclose the purchase price. According to Crunchbase, Okera previously raised just under $30 million. Investors include Felicis, Bessemer Venture Partners, Cyber Mentor Fund, ClearSky and Emergent Ventures.\n\nData governance was already a hot topic, but the recent focus on AI has highlighted some of the shortcomings of the previous approach to it, Databricks notes in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cHistorically, data governance technologies, regardless of sophistication, rely on enforcing control at some narrow waist layer and require workloads to fit into the \u2018walled garden\u2019 at this layer,\u201d the company explains in a blog post. That approach doesn\u2019t work anymore in the age of large language models (LLMs) because the number of assets is growing too quickly (in part because so much of it is machine-generated) and because the overall AI landscape is changing so quickly, standard access controls aren\u2019t able to capture these changes quickly enough.\n\nOkera then uses an AI-powered system that can automatically discover and classify personally identifiable information, tag it and apply rules to this (with a focus on the metadata), using a no-code interface.\n\nAs the Databricks team stressed, that\u2019s one of the reasons the company was interested in acquiring Okera, but the other is the service\u2019s isolation technology, which can enforce governance control on arbitrary workloads without any major overhead. This technology is still in private preview but was likely one of the major reasons Databricks acquired the company.\n\nDatabricks, which launched its own LLM a few weeks ago, plans to integrate Okera\u2019s technology into its Unity Catalog, its existing governance solution of data and AI assets. The company also noted that the acquisition will enable Databricks to expose additional APIs that its own data governance partners will be able to use to provide solutions to their customers.\n\nWith this acquisition, Databricks is also bringing Okera co-founder and CEO Nong Li on board. Li created the Apache Parquet data storage format and was actually briefly an engineer at Databricks between working at Cloudera and before starting Okera, where he was the founding CTO and became the CEO in February 2022.\n\n\u201cAs data continues to grow in volume, velocity, and variety across different applications, CIOs, CDOs, and CEOs across the board have to balance those two often conflicting initiatives \u2013 not to mention that historically, managing access policies across multiple clouds has been painful and time-consuming,\u201d writes Li in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cMany organizations don\u2019t have enough technical talent to manage access policies at scale, especially with the explosion of LLMs. What they need is a modern, AI-centric governance solution. We could not be more excited to join the Databricks team and to bring our expertise in building secure, scalable and simple governance solutions for some of the world\u2019s most forward-thinking enterprises.\u201d\n\nIf you know more about this acquisition, you can contact Frederic on Signal at (860) 208-3416 or by email (frederic@techcrunch.com).

Nova built five models that look for things that might seem out of whack. They run checks for brand safety, quality checking, whether it\u2019s on brand, whether it adheres to style and whether it\u2019s on campaign. Then it assigns each piece with a content score, and each company can decide what the threshold is for calling in a human to check the content before publishing.\n\n\u201cWhen you have generative AI creating stuff, you can now score it on a continuum. And then you can set thresholds, and if something\u2019s below, say 85% on brand, you can have the system flag it so that a human can take a look at it,\u201d he said. Companies can decide whatever threshold they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nBrandGPT is designed for working with third parties like an agency or a contractor, who can ask questions about the company\u2019s brand guidelines to make sure they are complying with them, May said. \u201cWe\u2019re launching BrandGPT, which is meant to be the interface to all this brand-related security stuff that we\u2019re doing, and as people interact with brands, they can access the style guides and better understand the brand, whether they\u2019re a part of the company or not.\n\nThese two products are available in public beta starting today.

Generative AI models \u201clearn\u201d to create art, code and more by \u201ctraining\u201d on sample images and text, usually scraped indiscriminately from the web.\n\nIn an effort to grant artists more control over how \u2014 and where \u2014 their art\u2019s used, Jordan Meyer and Mathew Dryhurst co-founded the startup Spawning AI. Spawning created HaveIBeenTrained, a website that allows creators to opt out of the training dataset for one art-generating AI model, Stable Diffusion v3, due to be released in the coming months.\n\nAs of March, artists had used HaveIBeenTrained to remove 80 million pieces of artwork from the Stable Diffusion training set. By late April, that figure had eclipsed 1 billion.\n\nAs the demand for Spawning\u2019s service grew, the company \u2014 which was entirely bootstrapped up until that point \u2014 sought an outside investment. And it got it. Spawning today announced that it raised $3 million in a seed round led by True Ventures with participation from the Seed Club Ventures, Abhay Parasnis, Charles Songhurst, Balaji Srinivisan, Jacob.eth and Noise DAO.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch via email, Meyer said that the funding will allow Spawning to continue developing \u201cIP standards for the AI era\u201d and establish more robust opt-out and opt-in standards.\n\n\u201cWe are enthusiastic about the potential of AI tooling. We developed domain expertise in the field from being passionate about new opportunities AI provides to creators, but feel that consent is a fundamental layer to make these developments something everyone can feel good about,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nSpawning\u2019s metrics speak for themselves. Clearly, there\u2019s a demand from artists for more say in how their art\u2019s used (or scraped, as the case may be). But beyond partnerships with art platforms like Shutterstock and ArtStation, Spawning hasn\u2019t managed to rally the industry around a common opt-out or provenance standard.\n\nAdobe, which recently announced generative AI tools, is pursuing its own opt-out mechanisms and tooling. So is DeviantArt, which in November launched a protection that relies on HTML tags to prohibit the software robots that crawl pages for images from downloading those images for training sets. OpenAI, the generative AI giant in the room, still doesn\u2019t offer an opt-out tool \u2014 nor has it announced plans to anytime soon.\n\nSpawning has also come under criticism for the opaqueness \u2014 and vagueness \u2014 of its opt-out process. As Ars Technica noted in a recent piece, the opt-out process doesn\u2019t appear to fit the definition of consent for personal data use in Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which states that consent must be actively given, not assumed by default. Also unclear is how Spawning intends to legally verify the identities of artists who make opt-out requests \u2014 or indeed, if it intends to attempt this at all.\n\nSpawning\u2019s solution is multipronged. First, it plans to make it easier for AI model trainers to honor opt-out requests and streamline the process for creators. Then, Spawning will offer more services to organizations seeking to protect the work of their artists, Meyer says.\n\n\u201cWe want to build the consent layer for AI, which we feel will be a fundamentally helpful piece of infrastructure moving forward,\u201d he added. \u201cWe plan to grow Spawning to address the many different domains touched by the AI economy, as each domain has their own particular needs.\u201d\n\nIn a first step toward this ambitious vision, Spawning in March enabled \u201cdomain opt-outs,\u201d allowing creators and content partners to quickly opt-out content from whole websites. Spawning says that 30,000 domains to date have been registered in the system.\n\nApril will mark the release of an API and open source Python package that\u2019ll greatly expand the breadth of content that Spawning touches. Previously, opt-out requests through Spawning only applied to the LAION-5B dataset \u2014 the dataset used to train Stable Diffusion. As of April, any website, app or service will be able to use Spawning\u2019s API to automatically comply with opt-outs not just for image data, but for text, audio, videos and more.\n\nMeyer says that Spawning will aggregate every new opt-out method (e.g.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4502, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "556117bc-bf63-4162-8847-dc54c9880ac4": {"__data__": {"id_": "556117bc-bf63-4162-8847-dc54c9880ac4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_name": "05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6865, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "15d7b73e-b41b-4eac-93d1-d8a5fd7692b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_name": "05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6865, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "d9aaf99fe6a68937d169aeb51ead50935a59976a406a87af2e4ddd25f505da07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51ce7f38-672d-4630-bac9-7fa49dca1600", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_name": "05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6865, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "6d5bf49159623efc9613702d1220b60085a5b2bfeee2e74d2a76d3d7c1cfd008", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed37babc-8b46-43e8-bb90-ca5b702472a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f08e2bf1977b37ea51817459290c5a8bbfc446eae6ed6c80575ab1aee9d6691", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4918b5dcc4881f1b4c78426c715e41322ccf77221c4037a16b3c0a25f8cfbf67", "text": "\u201cWe plan to grow Spawning to address the many different domains touched by the AI economy, as each domain has their own particular needs.\u201d\n\nIn a first step toward this ambitious vision, Spawning in March enabled \u201cdomain opt-outs,\u201d allowing creators and content partners to quickly opt-out content from whole websites.

The box will also link to a Spawning API sign-up page so that model trainers can remove opted-out images at training time.\n\n\u201cWe feel that once companies and developers know that the option to honor creator wishes is available, there is little reason not to honor them,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cWe are excited about the future of generative AI, but creators and organizations alike need standards in place to have their data work in their favor.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Spawning intends to release an \u201cexact-duplicate\u201d detection feature to match opted-out images with copies that the platform finds across the web, followed by a \u201cnear-duplicate\u201d detection feature to notify artists when Spawning finds likely copies of their work that\u2019ve been cropped, compressed or otherwise slightly modified.\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s plans for a Chrome extension to let creators pre-emptively opt out of their work posted anywhere on the web and a caption search on the HaveIBeenTrained website to directly search image descriptions. The site\u2019s current search tool uses only approximate matches between text and images as well as URL searches to find content hosted on specific websites.\n\nSpawning \u2014 now beholden to investors \u2014 plans to make money by building services on top of its content infrastructure, although Meyer wouldn\u2019t divulge much. How that\u2019ll sit with content creators remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to quite a few organizations, with many conversations being too premature to announce, and think that our funding announcement and increased visibility will go some way to offer assurances that what we are building is a robust and dependable standard to work with,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAfter we complete these features, we\u2019ll begin building infrastructure to support more datasets \u2014 including music, video and text.\u201d", "start_char_idx": 3590, "end_char_idx": 6737, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed37babc-8b46-43e8-bb90-ca5b702472a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed37babc-8b46-43e8-bb90-ca5b702472a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_name": "05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7607, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa4ecbe0-14b9-4410-89c8-ddf19db3886a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_name": "05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7607, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "13cec829391a89963bdd3439d7186c90a8eb0d136ac734b2ab2abaaa8f294ee4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "556117bc-bf63-4162-8847-dc54c9880ac4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_name": "05-03-spawning-lays-out-its-plans-for-letting-creators-opt-out-of-generative-ai-training.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6865, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "4918b5dcc4881f1b4c78426c715e41322ccf77221c4037a16b3c0a25f8cfbf67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4dda59b3-ffbe-4a7b-afeb-996dac1d6347", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "411dbf08a7137f98d921aeaffe2038117301b082fff3f53bda979dec19d7e93a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1f08e2bf1977b37ea51817459290c5a8bbfc446eae6ed6c80575ab1aee9d6691", "text": "Well that was fast. The U.K.\u2019s competition watchdog has announced an initial review of \u201cAI foundational models\u201d, such as the large language models (LLMs) which underpin OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s New Bing. Generative AI models which power AI art platforms such as OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E or Midjourney will also likely fall in scope.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its review will look at competition and consumer protection considerations in the development and use of AI foundational models \u2014 with the aim of understanding \u201chow foundation models are developing and producing an assessment of the conditions and principles that will best guide the development of foundation models and their use in the future\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s proposing to publish the review in \u201cearly September\u201d, with a deadline of June 2 for interested stakeholders to submit responses to inform its work.\n\n\u201cFoundation models, which include large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI), that have emerged over the past five years, have the potential to transform much of what people and businesses do. To ensure that innovation in AI continues in a way that benefits consumers, businesses and the UK economy, the government has asked regulators, including the [CMA], to think about how the innovative development and deployment of AI can be supported against five overarching principles: safety, security and robustness; appropriate transparency and explainability; fairness; accountability and governance; and contestability and redress,\u201d the CMA wrote in a press release.\u201d\n\nStanford University\u2019s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Center\u2019s Center for Research on Foundation Models is credited with coining the term \u201cfoundational models\u201d, back in 2021, to refer to AI systems that focus on training one model on a huge amount of data and adapting it to many applications.\n\n\u201cThe development of AI touches upon a number of important issues, including safety, security, copyright, privacy, and human rights, as well as the ways markets work. Many of these issues are being considered by government or other regulators, so this initial review will focus on the questions the CMA is best placed to address \u2014 what are the likely implications of the development of AI foundation models for competition and consumer protection?\u201d the CMA added.\n\nIn a statement, its CEO, Sarah Cardell, also said:\n\nAI has burst into the public consciousness over the past few months but has been on our radar for some time. It\u2019s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth. It\u2019s crucial that the potential benefits of this transformative technology are readily accessible to UK businesses and consumers while people remain protected from issues like false or misleading information. Our goal is to help this new, rapidly scaling technology develop in ways that ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.\n\nSpecifically, the U.K. competition regulator said its initial review of AI foundational models will:\n\nexamine how the competitive markets for foundation models and their use could evolve\n\nexplore what opportunities and risks these scenarios could bring for competition and consumer protection\n\nproduce guiding principles to support competition and protect consumers as AI foundation models develop\n\nWhile it may seen early for the antitrust regulator to conduct a review of such a fast-moving emerging technology the CMA is acting on government instruction.\n\nAn AI white paper published in March signalled ministers\u2019 preference to avoid setting any bespoke rules (or oversight bodies) to govern uses of artificial intelligence at this stage. However ministers said existing U.K. regulators \u2014 including the CMA, which was directly name-checked \u2014 would be expected to issue guidance to encourage safe, fair and accountable uses of AI.\n\nThe CMA says its initial review of foundational AI models is in line with instructions in the white paper, where the government talked about existing regulators conducting \u201cdetailed risk analysis\u201d in order to be in a position to carry out potential enforcements, i.e. on dangerous, unfair and unaccountable applications of AI, using their existing powers.\n\nThe regulator also points to its core mission \u2014 to support open, competitive markets \u2014 as another reason for taking a look at generative AI now.\n\nNotably, the competition watchdog is set to get additional powers to regulate Big Tech in the coming years, under plans taken off the back-burner by prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government last month, when ministers said it would move forward with a long-trailed (but much delayed) ex ante reform aimed at digital giants\u2019 market power.\n\nThe expectation is that the CMA\u2019s Digital Markets Unit, up and running since 2021 in shadow form, will (finally) gain legislative powers in the coming years to apply pro-active \u201cpro-competition\u201d rules which are tailored to platforms that are deemed to have \u201cstrategic market status\u201d (SMS).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5066, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dda59b3-ffbe-4a7b-afeb-996dac1d6347": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dda59b3-ffbe-4a7b-afeb-996dac1d6347", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_name": "05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7607, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa4ecbe0-14b9-4410-89c8-ddf19db3886a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_name": "05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7607, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "13cec829391a89963bdd3439d7186c90a8eb0d136ac734b2ab2abaaa8f294ee4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed37babc-8b46-43e8-bb90-ca5b702472a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_name": "05-04-cma-generative-ai-review.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7607, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "1f08e2bf1977b37ea51817459290c5a8bbfc446eae6ed6c80575ab1aee9d6691", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56c9ff8f-0ec7-40d6-a2b3-671197f3df47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e5da43c6db828a7eb0343b066ded59470d913626c845d6c41988871eb02e159", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "411dbf08a7137f98d921aeaffe2038117301b082fff3f53bda979dec19d7e93a", "text": "on dangerous, unfair and unaccountable applications of AI, using their existing powers.\n\nThe regulator also points to its core mission \u2014 to support open, competitive markets \u2014 as another reason for taking a look at generative AI now.\n\nNotably, the competition watchdog is set to get additional powers to regulate Big Tech in the coming years, under plans taken off the back-burner by prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government last month, when ministers said it would move forward with a long-trailed (but much delayed) ex ante reform aimed at digital giants\u2019 market power.\n\nThe expectation is that the CMA\u2019s Digital Markets Unit, up and running since 2021 in shadow form, will (finally) gain legislative powers in the coming years to apply pro-active \u201cpro-competition\u201d rules which are tailored to platforms that are deemed to have \u201cstrategic market status\u201d (SMS). So we can speculate that providers of powerful foundational AI models may, down the line, be judged to have SMS \u2014 meaning they could expect to face bespoke rules on how they must operate vis-a-vis rivals and consumers in the U.K. market.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s data protection watchdog, the ICO, also has its eye on generative AI. It\u2019s another existing oversight body which the government has tasked with paying special mind to AI under its plan for context-specific guidance to steer development of the tech through the application of existing laws.\n\nIn a blog post last month, Stephen Almond, the ICO\u2019s executive director of regulatory risk, offered some tips and a little warning for developers of generative AI when it comes to compliance with U.K. data protection rules. \u201cOrganisations developing or using generative AI should be considering their data protection obligations from the outset, taking a data protection by design and by default approach,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThis isn\u2019t optional \u2014 if you\u2019re processing personal data, it\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\nOver the English Channel in the European Union, meanwhile, lawmakers are in the process of deciding a fixed set of rules that are likely to apply to generative AI.\n\nNegotiations toward a final text for the EU\u2019s incoming AI rulebook are ongoing \u2014 but currently there\u2019s a focus on how to regulate foundational models via amendments to the risk-based framework for regulating uses of AI the bloc published in draft over two years ago.\n\nIt remains to be seen where the EU\u2019s co-legislators will end up on what\u2019s sometimes also referred to as general purpose AI. But, as we reported recently, parliamentarians are pushing for a layered approach to tackle safety issues with foundational models; the complexity of responsibilities across AI supply chains; and to address specific content concerns (like copyright) which are associated with generative AI.\n\nAdd to that, EU data protection law already applies to AI, of course. And privacy-focused investigations of models like ChatGPT are underway in the bloc \u2014 including in Italy where an intervention by the local watchdog led to OpenAI rushing out a series of privacy disclosures and controls last month.\n\nThe European Data Protection Board also recently set up a task force to support coordination between different data protection authorities on investigations of the AI chatbot.

Assuming the ethical, technical and legal issues are someday ironed out (and AI-powered coding tools don\u2019t cause more bugs and security exploits than they solve), they could cut development costs substantially while allowing coders to focus on more creative tasks.\n\nAccording to a study from the University of Cambridge, at least half of developers\u2019 efforts are spent debugging and not actively programming, which costs the software industry an estimated $312 billion per year. But so far, only a handful of code-generating AI systems have been made freely available to the public \u2014 reflecting the commercial incentives of the organizations building them (see: Replit).\n\nStarCoder, which by contrast is licensed to allow for royalty-free use by anyone, including corporations, was trained on over 80 programming languages as well as text from GitHub repositories, including documentation and programming notebooks. StarCoder integrates with Microsoft\u2019s Visual Studio Code code editor and, like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, can follow basic instructions (e.g., \u201ccreate an app UI\u201d) and answer questions about code.\n\nCongratulations to all the @BigCodeProject contributors that worked tirelessly over the last 6+ months to bring the vision of releasing a responsibly developed 15B parameter Code LLM to fruition. We cannot thank you enough for the collaboration & contributions to the community. https://t.co/282sCRJq3k \u2014 ServiceNow Research (@ServiceNowRSRCH) May 4, 2023\n\nLeandro von Werra, a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face and a co-lead on StarCoder, claims that StarCoder matches or outperforms the AI model from OpenAI that was used to power initial versions of Copilot.\n\n\u201cOne thing we learned from releases such as Stable Diffusion last year is the creativity and capability of the open-source community,\u201d von Werra told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWithin weeks of the release the community had built dozens of variants of the model as well as custom applications. Releasing a powerful code generation model allows anybody to fine-tune and adapt it to their own use-cases and will enable countless downstream applications.\u201d\n\nBuilding a model\n\nStarCoder is a part of Hugging Face\u2019s and ServiceNow\u2019s over-600-person BigCode project, launched late last year, which aims to develop \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d AI systems for code in an \u201copen and responsible\u201d way. Hugging Face supplied an in-house compute cluster of 512 Nvidia V100 GPUs to train the StarCoder model.\n\nVarious BigCode working groups focus on subtopics like collecting datasets, implementing methods for training code models, developing an evaluation suite and discussing ethical best practices. For example, the Legal, Ethics and Governance working group explored questions on data licensing, attribution of generated code to original code, the redaction of personally identifiable information (PII), and the risks of outputting malicious code.\n\nInspired by Hugging Face\u2019s previous efforts to open source sophisticated text-generating systems, BigCode seeks to address some of the controversies arising around the practice of AI-powered code generation. The nonprofit Software Freedom Conservancy among others has criticized GitHub and OpenAI for using public source code, not all of which is under a permissive license, to train and monetize Codex. Codex is available through OpenAI\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s paid APIs, while GitHub recently began charging for access to Copilot.\n\nFor their parts, GitHub and OpenAI assert that Codex and Copilot \u2014 protected by the doctrine of fair use, at least in the U.S. \u2014 don\u2019t run afoul of any licensing agreements.\n\n\u201cReleasing a capable code-generating system can serve as a research platform for institutions that are interested in the topic but don\u2019t have the necessary resources or know-how to train such models,\u201d von Werra said. \u201cWe believe that in the long run this leads to fruitful research on safety, capabilities and limits of code-generating systems.\u201d\n\nUnlike Copilot, the 15-billion-parameter StarCoder was trained over the course of several days on an open source dataset called The Stack, which has over 19 million curated, permissively licensed repositories and more than six terabytes of code in over 350 programming languages.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4643, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24d11976-d616-4b12-8fc7-14897f0de1e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "24d11976-d616-4b12-8fc7-14897f0de1e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model.txt", "file_name": "05-04-hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10067, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39907085-bb37-4694-a011-c2785ff9602e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model.txt", "file_name": "05-04-hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10067, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "9bc71d53a1950d594ae8b1f09bb82c65c444cc948ff21f08a55145952a965afb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56c9ff8f-0ec7-40d6-a2b3-671197f3df47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model.txt", "file_name": "05-04-hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10067, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "1e5da43c6db828a7eb0343b066ded59470d913626c845d6c41988871eb02e159", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "93f44185-87ec-4bae-bd93-007ffe7d0837", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5ef5bb9919cc7774de070529c419f4ef493eb040964429624ab1b973587717a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ec50ef26b2c5ec056004b121353890d2b0d81cd3dba35a23ad669a6a4a702574", "text": "Codex is available through OpenAI\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s paid APIs, while GitHub recently began charging for access to Copilot.\n\nFor their parts, GitHub and OpenAI assert that Codex and Copilot \u2014 protected by the doctrine of fair use, at least in the U.S. \u2014 don\u2019t run afoul of any licensing agreements.\n\n\u201cReleasing a capable code-generating system can serve as a research platform for institutions that are interested in the topic but don\u2019t have the necessary resources or know-how to train such models,\u201d von Werra said. \u201cWe believe that in the long run this leads to fruitful research on safety, capabilities and limits of code-generating systems.\u201d\n\nUnlike Copilot, the 15-billion-parameter StarCoder was trained over the course of several days on an open source dataset called The Stack, which has over 19 million curated, permissively licensed repositories and more than six terabytes of code in over 350 programming languages. In machine learning, parameters are the parts of an AI system learned from historical training data and essentially define the skill of the system on a problem, such as generating code.\n\nBecause it\u2019s permissively licensed, code from The Stack can be copied, modified and redistributed. But the BigCode project also provides a way for developers to \u201copt out\u201d of The Stack, similar to efforts elsewhere to let artists remove their work from text-to-image AI training datasets.\n\nThe BigCode team also worked to remove PII from The Stack, such as names, usernames, email and IP addresses, and keys and passwords. They created a separate dataset of 12,000 files containing PII, which they plan to release to researchers through \u201cgated access.\u201d\n\nBeyond this, the BigCode team used Hugging Face\u2019s malicious code detection tool to remove files from The Stack that might be considered \u201cunsafe,\u201d such as those with known exploits.\n\nThe privacy and security issues with generative AI systems, which for the most part are trained on relatively unfiltered data from the web, are well-established. ChatGPT once volunteered a journalist\u2019s phone number. And GitHub has acknowledged that Copilot may generate keys, credentials and passwords seen in its training data on novel strings.\n\n\u201cCode poses some of the most sensitive intellectual property for most companies,\u201d von Werra said. \u201cIn particular, sharing it outside their infrastructure poses immense challenges.\u201d\n\nTo his point, some legal experts have argued that code-generating AI systems could put companies at risk if they were to unwittingly incorporate copyrighted or sensitive text from the tools into their production software. As Elaine Atwell notes in a piece on Kolide\u2019s corporate blog, because systems like Copilot strip code of its licenses, it\u2019s difficult to tell which code is permissible to deploy and which might have incompatible terms of use.\n\nIn response to the criticisms, GitHub added a toggle that lets customers prevent suggested code that matches public, potentially copyrighted content from GitHub from being shown. Amazon, following suit, has CodeWhisperer highlight and optionally filter the license associated with functions it suggests that bear a resemblance to snippets found in its training data.\n\nCommercial drivers\n\nSo what does ServiceNow, a company that deals mostly in enterprise automation software, get out of this? A \u201cstrong-performing model and a responsible AI model license that permits commercial use,\u201d said Harm de Vries, the lead of the Large Language Model Lab at ServiceNow Research and the co-lead of the BigCode project.\n\nOne imagines that ServiceNow will eventually build StarCoder into its commercial products. The company wouldn\u2019t reveal how much, in dollars, it\u2019s invested in the BigCode project, save that the amount of donated compute was \u201csubstantial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Large Language Models Lab at ServiceNow Research is building up expertise on the responsible development of generative AI models to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of these powerful models for our customers,\u201d de Vries said. \u201cThe open-scientific research approach to BigCode provides ServiceNow developers and customers with full transparency into how everything was developed and demonstrates ServiceNow\u2019s commitment to making socially responsible contributions to the community.\u201d\n\nStarCoder isn\u2019t open source in the strictest sense. Rather, it\u2019s being released under a licensing scheme, OpenRAIL-M, that includes \u201clegally enforceable\u201d use case restrictions that derivatives of the model \u2014 and apps using the model \u2014 are required to comply with.\n\nFor example, StarCoder users must agree not to leverage the model to generate or distribute malicious code.

The BigCode project will maintain them going forward as the groups look to develop more capable code-generating models, fueled by input from the community.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly work to be done.

And it\u2019ll embrace multimodality, at least in the sense that Bing Chat will be able to answer questions within the context of images.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re underway with the transformation of search,\u201d Mehdi said in prepared remarks. \u201cIn our minds, we think that today will be the start of the next generation of this \u2018search mission.'\u201d\n\nOpen, and visual\n\nAs of today, the new Bing \u2014 the one with Bing Chat \u2014 is now available waitlist-free. Anyone can try it out by signing in with a Microsoft Account.\n\nIt\u2019s more or less the experience that launched several months ago. But as alluded to earlier, Bing Chat will soon respond with images \u2014 at least where it makes sense. Answers to questions (e.g. \u201cWhere is Machu Picchu?\u201d) will be accompanied by relevant images if any exist, much like the standard Bing search flow but condensed into a card-like interface.\n\nIn a demo at the event, a spokesperson typed the question \u201cDoes the saguaro cactus grow flowers?\u201d and Bing Chat pulled up a paragraph-long response alongside an image of the cactus in question. For me, it evoked the \u201cknowledge panels\u201d in Google Search.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t saying which categories of content, exactly, might trigger an image. But it does have filtering in place to prevent explicit images from appearing \u2014 or so it claims.\n\nSarah Bird, the head of responsible AI at Microsoft, told me that Bing Chat benefits from the filtering and moderation already in place with Bing search. Beyond this, Bing Chat uses a combination of \u201ctoxicity classifiers,\u201d or AI models trained to detect potentially harmful prompts, and blacklists to keep the chat relatively clean.\n\nThose measures didn\u2019t prevent Bing Chat from going off the rails when it first rolled out in preview in early February, it\u2019s worth noting. Our coverage found the chatbot spouting vaccine misinformation and writing a hateful screed from the perspective of Adolf Hitler. Other reporters got it to make threats, claim multiple identities and even shame them for admonishing it.\n\nIn another knock against Microsoft, the company just a few months ago laid off the ethics and society team within its larger AI organization. The move left Microsoft without a dedicated team to ensure its AI principles are closely tied to product design.\n\nBird, though, asserts that meaningful progress has been made and that these sorts of AI issues aren\u2019t solved overnight \u2014 public though Bing Chat may be. Among other measures, a team of human moderators is in place to watch for abuse, she said, such as users attempting to use Bing Chat to generate phishing emails.\n\nBut \u2014 as members of the press weren\u2019t given the chance to interact with the latest version of Bing beyond curated demos \u2014 I can\u2019t say to what extent all that\u2019s made a difference. It\u2019ll doubtless become clear once more folks get their hands on it.\n\nOne aspect of Bing Chat that is improving is the transparency around its responses \u2014 specifically responses of a fact-based nature. Soon, when asked to summarize a document or about the contents a document (e.g. \u201cwhat does this page say about the Brooklyn Bridge?\u201d), whether a 20-page PDF or a Wikipedia article, Bing Chat will include citations indicating from where in the text the information came from. Clicking on them will highlight the corresponding passage.\n\nProductivity emergent\n\nIn another new feature on the visual front, Bing Chat will be able to create charts and graphs when fed the right prompt and data.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4661, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd853620-602b-4514-811f-591e690c6737": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd853620-602b-4514-811f-591e690c6737", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features.txt", "file_name": "05-04-microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11643, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ac4c028-c5b7-4452-b6b0-ad2af27cfdfe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features.txt", "file_name": "05-04-microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11643, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "7c849b354eea80033da5fb040e00e6b5d0b4dc47f64891218f1c118826904349", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "058565bf-18c7-4ea2-9b39-826837364a15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-04-microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features.txt", "file_name": "05-04-microsoft-doubles-down-on-ai-with-new-bing-features.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11643, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "f42960837e1b8cf05149dbabcbb343f6f52294eda308ff8a1a15cc618a271cd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f13f2e3-92e4-4427-9388-984f2b70a1d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e1a7153df703dc50b58f7b8082d0cd38dcbf748645a16ec7a0461e70a309dfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b5c2f52d4ea1f7bb52701119bec7158383740db7888640955e3be2a994c991b1", "text": "But \u2014 as members of the press weren\u2019t given the chance to interact with the latest version of Bing beyond curated demos \u2014 I can\u2019t say to what extent all that\u2019s made a difference.

Clicking on them will highlight the corresponding passage.\n\nProductivity emergent\n\nIn another new feature on the visual front, Bing Chat will be able to create charts and graphs when fed the right prompt and data. Previously, asking something like \u201cWhich are the most populous cities in Brazil?\u201d would yield a basic list of results. But in a near-future preview, Bing Chat will present those results visually and in the chart type of a user\u2019s choosing.\n\nThis seemingly represents a step for Bing toward a full-blown productivity platform, particularly when paired with the enhanced text-to-image generation capabilities coming down the pipeline.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Bing Image Creator \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s tool that can generate images from text prompts, powered by DALL-E 2 \u2014 will understand more languages aside from English (over 100 total). As with English, users will be able to refine the images they generate with follow-up prompts (e.g. \u201cMake an image of a bunny rabbit,\u201d followed by \u201cnow make the fur pink\u201d).\n\nGenerative art AI has been in the headlines a lot, lately \u2014 and not for the most optimistic of reasons necessarily.\n\nPlaintiffs have brought several lawsuits against OpenAI and its rival vendors, alleging that copyrighted data \u2014 mostly art \u2014 was used without their permission to train generative models like DALL-E 2. Generative models \u201clearn\u201d to create art and more by \u201ctraining\u201d on sample images and text, usually scraped indiscriminately from the public web.\n\nI asked Bird about whether Microsoft is exploring ways to compensate creators whose work was swept up in training data, even if the company\u2019s official position is that it\u2019s a matter of fair use. Several platforms launching generative AI tools, including Shutterstock, have kick-started creators funds along these lines. Others, like Spawning, are creating mechanisms to let artists opt out of AI model training altogether.\n\nBird implied that these issues will eventually have to be confronted \u2014 and that content creators deserve some form of recompense. But she wasn\u2019t willing to commit to anything concrete this week.\n\nMultimodal search\n\nElsewhere on the image front, Bing Chat is gaining the ability to understand images as well as text. Users will be able to upload images and search the web for related content, for example copying a link to an image of a crocheted octopus and asking Bing Chat the question \u201chow do I make that?\u201d to get step-by-step instructions.\n\nMultimodality powers the new page context function in the Edge app for mobile, as well. Users will be able to ask questions in Bing Chat related to the mobile page they\u2019re viewing.\n\nMicrosoft wouldn\u2019t say either way, but it seems likely that these new multimodal abilities stem from GPT-4, which can understand images in addition to text. When OpenAI announced GPT-4, it didn\u2019t make the model\u2019s image understanding capabilities available to all customers \u2014 and still hasn\u2019t. I\u2019d wager that Microsoft, though, being a major investor in and close collaborator with OpenAI, has some sort of privileged access.\n\nAny image upload tool can be abused, of course, which is why Microsoft is employing automated filtering and hashing to block illicit uploads, according to Bird. The jury\u2019s out on how well these work, though \u2014 we weren\u2019t given the chance to test image uploads ourselves.\n\nNew chat features\n\nMultimodality and new visual features aren\u2019t all that\u2019s coming to Bing Chat.\n\nSoon, Bing Chat will store users\u2019 chat histories, letting them pick up where they left off and return to previous chats when they wish. It\u2019s an experience akin to the chat history feature OpenAI recently brought to ChatGPT, showing a list of chats and the bot\u2019s responses to each of those chats.\n\nThe specifics of the chat history feature have yet to be ironed out, like how long chats will be stored, exactly.

But users will be able to delete their history at any time regardless, Microsoft says \u2014 addressing the criticisms several European Union governments had against ChatGPT.\n\nBing Chat will also gain export and share functionalities, letting users share conversations on social media or to a Word document. Dena Saunders, a partner GM in Microsoft\u2019s web experiences team, told TechCrunch that a more robust copy-and-paste system is in the works \u2014 but not in preview just yet \u2014 for graphs and images created through Bing Chat.\n\nPerhaps the most transformative addition to Bing Chat, though, is plugins. From partners like OpenTable and Wolfram Alpha, plugins greatly extend what Bing Chat can do, for example helping users book a reservation or create visualizations and get answers to challenging science and math questions.\n\nLike chat history, the not-yet-live plugins functionality is in the very preliminary stages. There\u2019s no plugins marketplace to speak of; plugins can be toggled on or off from the Bing Chat web interface.\n\nSaunders hinted, but wouldn\u2019t confirm, that the Bing Chat plugins scheme was associated with \u2014 or perhaps identical to \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s recently introduced plugins for ChatGPT. That\u2019d certainly make sense, given the similarities between the two.\n\nEdge, refreshed\n\nBing Chat is available through Edge as well as the web, of course. And Edge is getting a fresh coat of paint alongside Bing Chat.\n\nFirst previewed in February, the new and improved Edge features rounded corners in line with Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 design philosophy. Elements in the browser are now more \u201ccontainerized,\u201d as one Microsoft spokesperson put it, and there\u2019s subtle tweaks throughout, like the Microsoft Account image moving left-of-center.\n\nIn Compose, Edge\u2019s Bing Chat-powered tool that can write emails and more given a basic prompt (e.g. \u201cwrite an invitation to my dog\u2019s birthday party\u201d), a new option lets users adjust the length, phrasing and tone of the generated text to nearly anything they\u2019d like. Type in the desired tone, and Bing Chat will write a message to match \u2014 Bird says filters are in place to prevent the use of clearly problematic tones, like \u201chateful\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nFar more intriguing than Compose, though \u2014 at least to me \u2014 are actions in Edge, which translate certain Bing Chat prompts into automations.\n\nTyping a command like \u201cbring my passwords from another browser\u201d in Bing Chat in the Edge sidebar opens Edge\u2019s browsing data settings page, while the prompt \u201cplay \u2018The Devil Wears Prada'\u201d pulls up a list of streaming options including Vudu and (predictably) the Microsoft Store. There\u2019s even an action that automatically organizes \u2014 and color-coordinates \u2014 browsing tabs.\n\nActions are in a primitive stage at present. But it\u2019s clear where Microsoft\u2019s going, here. One imagines actions eventually expanding beyond Edge to reach other Microsoft products, like Office 365, and perhaps one day the whole Windows desktop.\n\nSaunders wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny that this is the endgame. \u201cStay tuned for Microsoft Build,\u201d she told me, referring to Microsoft\u2019s upcoming developer conference.

Today, at the Salesforce World Tour event in NYC, the company announced the next step in its platform\u2019s evolution where it will be putting AI at the forefront of the user experience, making it easier to get information and build workflows.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are announcements, and many of these features are not available yet.\n\nRob Seaman says that rather than slapping on an AI cover, they are working to incorporate it in a variety of ways across the platform. That started last month with a small step, a partnership with OpenAI to bring a ChatGPT app into Slack, the first piece of a much broader vision for AI on the platform. That part is in beta at the moment.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement involves several new integrations, including SlackGPT, the company\u2019s own flavor of generative AI built on top of the Slack platform, which users and developers can tap into to build AI-driven experiences. The content in Slack provides a starting point for building models related to the platform.\n\n\u201cWe think Slack has a unique advantage when it comes to generative AI. A lot of the institutional knowledge on every topic, team, work item and project is already in Slack through the messages, the files and the clips that are shared every day,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen you combine that with Slack\u2019s Partner ecosystem and platform, customers have a lot of options for integrating AI into their workflows. He says that Slack is thinking about this in three ways right now.\n\n\u201cFor starters, Slack is going to bring AI natively into the user experience with SlackGPT to help customers work faster, communicate better, learn faster, etc. And an example of that is AI-powered conversation summaries and writing assistance for composition that\u2019s going to be directly available in Slack,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former could as an example help employees get caught up on a long thread without having to read every message to get the gist of what was being discussed. The latter could help generate Slack messages or content for linked Slack applications. That\u2019s a little less obvious use case. It\u2019s probably easier to write a Slack message yourself unless it\u2019s an automated message that\u2019s part of a workflow, but if you are creating content for Slack Canvas, you could let the generative AI help you.\n\nDevelopers can get in on the action too, building AI steps into workflows, giving them the option of tapping into external apps and large language models to build generative AI experiences themselves. Just last week the company made its updated developer experience generally available, and this should make it easier to incorporate generative AI into the platform in customized ways, Seaman says.\n\n\u201cSo this gives us the foundation to give users choice and flexibility to bring AI into their work in their business whenever they\u2019re ready, and however they like. We\u2019ve got 2,600 apps in the ecosystem right now, which includes a lot of the leading LLMs, and we see a lot of customers already choosing to integrate generative AI into Slack themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally EinsteinGPT, the Salesforce flavor of generative AI announced in March, will also be incorporated into Slack, letting employees ask questions directly about Salesforce content, like the users most likely to churn or the accounts most likely to buy, and so forth. This is really about more directly integrating Salesforce content into Slack, the company Salesforce paid $27 billion for a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cSlack is really becoming the conversational interface for Salesforce. So that\u2019s bringing those EinsteinGPT-powered insights from the real-time customer data that exists in Salesforce into Slack to enrich every team\u2019s understanding of the customer,\u201d he said.\n\nAs with most of the generative AI tooling we\u2019ve seen being added to enterprise software, Slack is announcing these capabilities long before they release them, but this should give customers a sense of what\u2019s coming, and how AI could be transforming Slack in the future. SlackGPT and EinsteinGPT integration are still in the development phase, but developers can build custom integrations with a variety of LLMs, today.

This Zerg-like threat may not be an existential one, but it will certainly keep the dominant players on the defensive.\n\nThe notion is not new by a long shot \u2014 in the fast-moving AI community, it\u2019s expected to see this kind of disruption on a weekly basis \u2014 but the situation was put in perspective by a widely shared document purported to originate within Google. \u201cWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,\u201d the memo reads.\n\nI won\u2019t encumber the reader with a lengthy summary of this perfectly readable and interesting piece, but the gist is that while GPT-4 and other proprietary models have obtained the lion\u2019s share of attention and indeed income, the head start they\u2019ve gained with funding and infrastructure is looking slimmer by the day.\n\nWhile the pace of OpenAI\u2019s releases may seem blistering by the standards of ordinary major software releases, GPT-3, ChatGPT and GPT-4 were certainly hot on each other\u2019s heels if you compare them to versions of iOS or Photoshop. But they are still occurring on the scale of months and years.\n\nWhat the memo points out is that in March, a leaked foundation language model from Meta, called LLaMA, was leaked in fairly rough form. Within weeks, people tinkering around on laptops and penny-a-minute servers had added core features like instruction tuning, multiple modalities and reinforcement learning from human feedback. OpenAI and Google were probably poking around the code, too, but they didn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 replicate the level of collaboration and experimentation occurring in subreddits and Discords.\n\nCould it really be that the titanic computation problem that seemed to pose an insurmountable obstacle \u2014 a moat \u2014 to challengers is already a relic of a different era of AI development?\n\nSam Altman already noted that we should expect diminishing returns when throwing parameters at the problem. Bigger isn\u2019t always better, sure \u2014 but few would have guessed that smaller was instead.\n\nGPT-4 is a Walmart, and nobody actually likes Walmart\n\nThe business paradigm being pursued by OpenAI and others right now is a direct descendant of the SaaS model. You have some software or service of high value and you offer carefully gated access to it through an API or some such. It\u2019s a straightforward and proven approach that makes perfect sense when you\u2019ve invested hundreds of millions into developing a single monolithic yet versatile product like a large language model.\n\nIf GPT-4 generalizes well to answering questions about precedents in contract law, great \u2014 never mind that a huge number of its \u201cintellect\u201d is dedicated to being able to parrot the style of every author who ever published a work in the English language. GPT-4 is like a Walmart. No one actually wants to go there, so the company makes damn sure there\u2019s no other option.\n\nBut customers are starting to wonder, why am I walking through 50 aisles of junk to buy a few apples? Why am I hiring the services of the largest and most general-purpose AI model ever created if all I want to do is exert some intelligence in matching the language of this contract against a couple hundred other ones? At the risk of torturing the metaphor (to say nothing of the reader), if GPT-4 is the Walmart you go to for apples, what happens when a fruit stand opens in the parking lot?\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long in the AI world for a large language model to be run, in highly truncated form of course, on (fittingly) a Raspberry Pi. For a business like OpenAI, its jockey Microsoft, Google or anyone else in the AI-as-a-service world, it effectively beggars the entire premise of their business: that these systems are so hard to build and run that they have to do it for you. In fact it starts to look like these companies picked and engineered a version of AI that fit their existing business model, not vice versa!\n\nOnce upon a time you had to offload the computation involved in word processing to a mainframe \u2014 your terminal was just a display. Of course that was a different era, and we\u2019ve long since been able to fit the whole application on a personal computer.

Google didn\u2019t get where it is by being the best \u2014 not for a long time, anyway. Being a Walmart has its benefits. Companies don\u2019t want to have to find the bespoke solution that performs the task they want 30% faster if they can get a decent price from their existing vendor and not rock the boat too much. Never underestimate the value of inertia in business!\n\nSure, people are iterating on LLaMA so fast that they\u2019re running out of camelids to name them after. Incidentally, I\u2019d like to thank the developers for an excuse to just scroll through hundreds of pictures of cute, tawny vicu\u00f1as instead of working. But few enterprise IT departments are going to cobble together an implementation of Stability\u2019s open source derivative-in-progress of a quasi-legal leaked Meta model over OpenAI\u2019s simple, effective API. They\u2019ve got a business to run!\n\nBut at the same time, I stopped using Photoshop years ago for image editing and creation because the open source options like Gimp and Paint.net have gotten so incredibly good. At this point, the argument goes the other direction. Pay how much for Photoshop? No way, we\u2019ve got a business to run!\n\nWhat Google\u2019s anonymous authors are clearly worried about is that the distance from the first situation to the second is going to be much shorter than anyone thought, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be a damn thing anybody can do about it.\n\nExcept, the memo argues: embrace it.

The kickoff keynote is always jammed-packed full of information, debuting all of the different software projects the company has been working on for the past year.\n\nUpdate: Google just went ahead and announced the Pixel Fold over on Twitter. The company gave a good look at the upcoming foldable smartphone from just about every angle. That means all three of the expected pieces of hardware \u2013 including the Pixel 7a and Pixel Tablet \u2013 have officially been announced.\n\nThe event, which kicks off May 10 at 10 AM PT will be a big showcase for everything that\u2019s on the way for Android 14. The company has, arguably, missed a step when it comes to the current generative AI land rush \u2014 hell, who could have predicted after all of these years that Bing would finally have a moment?\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai will no doubt be making the case that the company continues to lead the way in the world of artificial intelligence. There\u2019s always been a fair bit of the stuff at the event largely focused on practical real-world applications like mobile imaging and dealing with customer service. This year, however, I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe to say the company is going to go bonkers with the stuff.\n\nHardware, meanwhile, is always a bit of a crapshoot at developer conferences. But after an off-year for the industry at large, a deluge of rumors are aligning, pointing to what\u2019s likely to be an unusually consumer electronics-focused keynote. Given the fact that the last bit is my focus at TechCrunch, I\u2019m going to start the list there.\n\nThe Pixel 7a is about as sure as bets get. Google has settled into a comfortable release cadence: releasing a flagship in the fall, followed by a budget device in the spring. The former is designed to be an ideal showcase for its latest mobile operating system and first-party silicon, while the latter makes some compromises for price, while maintaining as many of its predecessors as possible.\n\nHow to show excitement without shouting? Asking for a friend Coming to @Flipkart on 11th May. pic.twitter.com/il6GUx3MmR \u2014 Google India (@GoogleIndia) May 2, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s a good system that works, and Google\u2019s newly focused mobile hardware team has created some surprisingly good devices at extremely reasonable prices. Never one to be outdone by the deluge of rumors, the company went ahead and announced via Twitter its next device is due out on May 11 \u2014 the day after Google I/O and, perhaps not coincidentally, my birthday. It was Google India that specifically made the announcement \u2014 perhaps not surprising, as the company is likely to aggressively target the world\u2019s number one smartphone market with the product. The image points to a very similar design as the 7 \u2014 not really a surprise as these things go. Though it does stop short of actually mentioning the name, as it\u2019s done in the past.\n\nBasically expect the 7 with cheaper materials. Rumors point to a 6.1-inch device featuring a 90Hz refresh rate, coupled with a 64-megapixel rear camera. The 7\u2019s Tensor G2 returns for a command performance, likely bringing with it many of the software features it enabled the first time around.\n\nWe know for sure that a Pixel Tablet is coming\u2026at some point. Google confirmed the device\u2019s existence at last year\u2019s event, providing a broad 2023 release date, along with a render alongside the rest of the current Pixel lineup. Effectively there are two points this year Google is likely to officially announce the thing: next week or September/October. I would be shocked if the company\u2019s long-awaited (?) reentry into the category doesn\u2019t, at the very least, get a bit of stage time. As a category, the Android tablet has been very hit or miss over the years \u2014 presumably/hopefully the company\u2019s got a unique spin here. I would be surprised if Google jumped back into the space without some sort of novel angle.\n\nThe leaks point to a design that would effectively turn the system into one giant Nest dock.

Other rumors include the aforementioned Tensor G2, coupled with 8GB of RAM.\n\nHere\u2019s your wildcard, folks: the Pixel Fold. Google has seemingly been laying the groundwork for its own foldable for years. Here\u2019s what I wrote a couple of weeks ago:\n\nSome important background here. First, Google announced foldable screen support for Android back in 2018. Obviously, Samsung was both the big partner and recipient in those days, and Google wanted to make Android development as frictionless as possible for other OEMs in exploring the form factor. The following year, Google foldable patents surfaced. Now, we\u2019re all adults here, who implicitly understand that patents don\u2019t mean a company is working on a product. That said, it\u2019s another key data point in this story. In the intervening years, foldables have begun gathering steam, even outside of the Samsung orbit. I was genuinely amazed by how many different models there were populating the halls of MWC back in March. The leaked renders point to a form factor that is more Samsung Galaxy Z Fold than Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. It also looks like it shares some common design DNA with Oppo\u2019s recently foldable, which is frankly the right direction. EV Leaks says the foldable is half an inch thick when folded and 0.2 inches unfolded, weight in at 283 grams.\n\nAs evidenced by our trip to MWC back in February, foldables are no longer fringe devices. It\u2019s true that they\u2019re still cost-prohibitive for most, but it\u2019s getting to the point soon where nearly ever Android manufacturer will have their take on the category. So why shouldn\u2019t Google?\n\nOther less likely hardware rumors include a Google/Nest AirTag competitor (the company announced yesterday that it\u2019s working with Apple to create a standard for the category), new Pixel Buds and a Pixel Watch 2. I\u2019d say all are unlikely \u2014 that last one in particular. We didn\u2019t get much in terms of Nest products last year, but so far not much is forthcoming in terms of rumors for home products.\n\nAndroid is always a tentpole of Google I/O for obvious reasons. We\u2019ve already caught some major glimpses of the mobile operating system, by way of beta releases. As Frederic noted in March, \u201cSo far, most of the features Google has talked about have also been developer-centric, with only a few user-facing features exposed to far. That also holds true for this second preview, which mostly focuses on added new security and privacy features.\u201d\n\nThe operating system, which is apparently named Upside Down Cake internally, is likely set for a summer release in late-July or August. At the top of the list of potential features are a boost to battery life (can always use one of those), additional accessibility features and privacy/security features, which include blocking users from installing ancient apps over malware concerns.\n\nAI is going to be everywhere. Expect generative AI (Bard) in particular to make appearances in virtually every existing piece of Google consumer software, following the lead of Gmail and Docs. Search and the Chrome browser are prime targets here.\n\nA preview of a new Wear OS seems likely. I don\u2019t anticipate a ton of news on the AR/VR side of things, but I would also be surprised if it doesn\u2019t at least get a nod, given what Apple reportedly has in the works for June.\n\nThe keynote kicks off at 10 AM PT on May 10.

Today he wears many hats, among them VP and chief internet evangelist at Google. He is to be awarded the IEEE\u2019s Medal of Honor at a gala in Atlanta, and ahead of the occasion he spoke with TechCrunch in a wide-ranging interview touching on his work, AI, accessibility and interplanetary internet.\n\nTechCrunch: To start out with, can you tell us how Google has changed in your time there?\n\nCerf: Well, when I joined the company in 2005, there were 5,000 people already, which is pretty damn big. And of course, my normal attire is three piece suits. The important thing is that I thought I would be raising the sartorial quotient of the company by joining. And now, almost 18 years later, there are 170-some-odd thousand people, and I have failed miserably. So I hope you don\u2019t mind if I take my jacket off.\n\nGo right ahead.\n\nSo as you might have noticed, Sergey has come back to do a little bit more on the artificial intelligence side of things, which is something he\u2019s always been interested in; I would say historically, we\u2019ve always had an interest in artificial intelligence. But that has escalated significantly over the past decade or so. The acquisition of DeepMind was a brilliant choice. And you can see some of the outcomes first of the spectacular stuff, like playing Go and winning. And then the more productive stuff, like figuring out how 200 million proteins are folded up.\n\nThen there\u2019s the large language models and the chatbots. And I think we\u2019re still in a very peculiar period of time, where we\u2019re trying to characterize what these things can and can\u2019t do, and how they go off the rails, and how do you take advantage of them to do useful work? How do we get them to distinguish fact from fiction? All of that is in my view open territory, but then that\u2019s always an exciting place to be \u2014 a place where nobody\u2019s ever been before. The thrill of discovery and the risk of hazard create a fairly exciting mix \u2014 an exhilarating mix.\n\nYou gave a talk recently about, I don\u2019t want to say the dangers of the large language models, but\u2026\n\nWell, I did say there are hazards there. I was talking to a bunch of investment bankers, or VCs, and I said, you know, don\u2019t try to sell stuff to your investors just because it\u2019s flashy and shiny. Be cautious about going too fast and trying to apply it without figuring out how to put guardrails in place.\n\nI raised a question of hazard and wanting people to be more thoughtful about which applications made sense. I even suggested an analogy: you know how the Society of Automotive Engineers, they have different risk levels for the self driving cars \u2014 a risk level idea could apply to artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nFor entertainment purposes, perhaps it\u2019s not too concerning, unless it goes down some dark path, in which case, you might want to put some friction into the system to deal with that, especially a younger user. But then, as you get to the point where you\u2019re training these things to do medical diagnosis or make investment advice, or make decisions about whether somebody gets out of jail\u2026 now suddenly, the risk factors are extremely high.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be unaware of those risk factors. We can, as we build applications, be prepared to detect excursions away from safe territory, so that we don\u2019t accidentally inflict some harm by the use of these kinds of technologies.\n\nSo we need some kind of guardrails.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not expert in this space, but I am beginning to wonder whether we need something kind of like that in order to provide a \u201csuper-ego\u201d for the natural language network. So when it starts to go off the rails somewhere, we can observe that that\u2019s happening. And a second network that\u2019s observing both the input and the output might intervene, somehow, and stop the the production of the output.\n\nSort of a conscience function?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not quite conscience, it\u2019s closer to executive function \u2014 the prefrontal cortex.

I want to be careful, I\u2019m only reasoning by metaphor here.\n\nI know that Microsoft has embarked on something like this. Their version of GPT-4 has an intermediary model like that, they call it Prometheus.\n\nPurely as an observation, I had the impression that the Prometheus natural language model would detect and intervene if it thought that the interactions were going down with dark path. I thought that they would implement it in such a way that before you actually say something to the interlocutor that is going down the dark path, you intervene and prevent it from going there at all.\n\nMy impression, though, is that it actually produces the output and then discovers that it\u2019s produced it, but and then it says, \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t have done that. Oh, dear, I take that back,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore about that.\u201d It\u2019s a little bit like the email that you get occasionally from the Microsoft Outlook system that says, \u201cThis person would like to withdraw the message.\u201d\n\nI love when that happens\u2026 it makes me want to read the original message so badly, even if I wouldn\u2019t have before.\n\nYeah, exactly. It\u2019s sort of like putting a big red flag in there saying, boy there\u2019s something juicy in here.\n\nYou mentioned the AI models, that it\u2019s an interesting place to work. Do you get the same sort of foundational flavor that you got from working on protocols and other big shared things over the years?\n\nWell, what we are seeing is emergent properties of these large language models, that are not necessarily anticipated. And there have been emergent properties showing up in the protocol world. Flow control in particular is a vast headache in the online packet switch environment, and people have been tackling these problems inside and outside of Google for years.\n\nOne of the examples of emergent properties that I think very few of us thought about is the domain name business. Once they had value, suddenly, all kinds of emergent properties show up, people with interests that conflict and have to be resolved. Same for internet address space, it\u2019s an even more weird environment where people actually buy IPv4 addresses for like $50 each.\n\nI confess to you that as I watched the auctions for IPv4 address space, I was thinking how stupid I was. When I was at the Defense Department in charge of all this, I should have allocated the slash eight, which is 16 million addresses, to myself, and just sit on it, you know, for 50 years, then sell it and retire.\n\nEven simple systems have the ability to surprise you. Especially when you have simple systems when a large number of them are interacting with each other. I\u2019ve found myself not necessarily recognizing when these emergent properties will come, but I will say that whenever something gets monetized, you should anticipate there will be emergent properties and possibly unexpected behavior, all driven by greed.\n\nLet me ask you about some some other stuff you\u2019re working on. I\u2019m always happy when I see cutting-edge tech being applied to people who need it, people with disabilities, people who like just have not been addressed by the current use cases of tech.

I\u2019m always happy when I see cutting-edge tech being applied to people who need it, people with disabilities, people who like just have not been addressed by the current use cases of tech.

Also, it\u2019s just nice to know that you\u2019re not alone in some of these challenges. There\u2019s another group called the Grayglers for people that have a little gray in their hair, and I\u2019m the executive sponsor for that. And of course, the focus of attention there is the challenges that arise as you get older, even as you think about retirement and things like that.\n\nWhen a lot of so-called Web 2.0 stuff came out 10 years ago, it was totally inaccessible, broke all the screen readers, all this kind of stuff. Somebody has to step in and say, look, we need to have this standard, or else you\u2019re leaving out millions of people. So I\u2019m always interested to hear about what interesting projects or organizations or people are out there.\n\nWhat I have come to believe is that engineers, being just given a set of specs that say if you do it this way, it will meet this level of the standard\u2026 that doesn\u2019t necessarily produce intuition. You really have to have some intuition in order to make things accessible.\n\nSo I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that what we really need is to show people examples of something which is not accessible, and something that is, and let them ingest as many examples as we can give them, because their neural networks will eventually figure out, what is it about this design that makes it accessible? And how do I apply that insight into the next design that I do? So, seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t work is really important. And you often learn a lot more from what doesn\u2019t work than you do from what does.\n\nThere\u2019s a guy named Gregg Vanderheiden, who\u2019s at the University of Maryland, he and I did a two-day event [the Future of Interface Workshop] looking at research on accessibility and trying to frame what this is going to look like over the next 10 or 20 years. It really is quite astonishing what the technology might be able to do to act as an augmenting capability for people that that need assistance. There\u2019s great excitement, but at the same time great disappointment, because we haven\u2019t used it as effectively as I think we could have. It\u2019s kind of like how Alexander Graham Bell invented a telephone that can\u2019t be used by people who are deaf, which is why he was working on it in the first place.\n\nIt is a funny contradiction of priorities. One thing where I do see some of the the large language and multimodal AI models helping out is that they can describe what they are seeing, even if you can\u2019t see it. I know that one of GPT-4\u2019s first applications was in an application for blind people to view the world around them.\n\nWe\u2019re experiencing something close to that right this minute. Since I wear hearing aids, I\u2019m making use of the captioning capability. And at the moment since this is Zoom rather than a Google Meet, there isn\u2019t any setting on this one for closed captioning.

As you say, these tools will become more and more normal, and as time goes on, people will expect the system to adapt to their needs.\n\nSo language translation, and speech recognition is quite powerful, but I do want to mention something that I found vaguely unsettling. Recently, I encountered an example of a conversation between a reporter and a chatbot. But he chose deliberately to take the output of the chat bot and have it spoken by the system. And he chose the style of a famous British explorer [David Attenborough].\n\nThe text itself was quite well formed, but coming with Attenborough\u2019s accent just added to the weight of the assertions even when they were wrong. The confidence levels, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, are very high, even when the thing doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s talking about.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is that we are allowing in these indicators of, how should we say this, of quality, to fool us. Because in the past, they really did mean it was David Attenborough. But here it\u2019s not, it\u2019s just his voice. I got to thinking about this, and I realized there was an ancient example of exactly this problem that showed up 50 years ago at Xerox PARC.\n\nThey had a laser printer, and they had the Alto workstation, and the Bravo text editor, it meant the first draft of anything you type to be printed out beautifully formatted with lovely forms and everything else. Normally, you would never see that production quality until after everything had been edited, you know, wrestled with by everybody to get the text formatted, picture-perfect stuff. That meant the first draft stuff came out looking like it was final draft. People didn\u2019t didn\u2019t understand that they were nuts, that they were seeing first-round stuff, and that it wasn\u2019t complete, or necessarily even satisfactory.\n\nSo it occurred to me that we\u2019ve reached a point now where technology is fooling us into giving it more weight than it deserves, because of certain indicia that used to be indicative of the investment made in producing it. And\u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure what to do about that.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is!\n\nI think somehow or another, we need to make it clear what the provenance is of the thing that we\u2019re looking at. Like how we needed to say this is first-draft material, you know, don\u2019t make any assumptions. So provenance turns out to be a very important concept, especially in a world where we have the ability to imbue content with attributes that we would normally interpret in one way. Like, it\u2019s David Attenborough speaking, and we should listen to that. And yet, which have to be, we have to think more critically about them. Because in fact, the attribute is being delivered artificially.\n\nAnd perhaps maliciously.\n\nCertainly that too. And this is why critical thinking has become an important skill. But it doesn\u2019t work very well, unless you have enough information to understand the provenance of the material that you\u2019re looking at. I think we are going to have to invest more in provenance and identity in order to evaluate the quality of that which we are experiencing.\n\nI wanted to ask you about interplanetary internet, because that whole area is extremely interesting to me.\n\nWell, this one, of course, gets started way back in 1998.

The latest systems can conjure up scenescapes from city skylines to cafes, creating images that appear startlingly realistic \u2014 at least on first glance.\n\nBut one of the longstanding weaknesses of text-to-image AI models is, ironically, text. Even the best models struggle to generate images with legible logos, much less text, calligraphy or fonts.\n\nBut that might change.\n\nLast week, DeepFloyd, a research group backed by Stability AI, unveiled DeepFloyd IF, a text-to-image model that can \u201csmartly\u201d integrate text into images. Trained on a dataset of more than a billion images and text, DeepFloyd IF, which requires a GPU with at least 16GB of RAM to run, can create an image from a prompt like \u201ca teddy bear wearing a shirt that reads \u2018Deep Floyd'\u201d \u2014 optionally in a range of styles.\n\nDeepFloyd IF is available in open source, licensed in a way that prohibits commercial use \u2014 for now. The restriction was likely motivated by the current tenuous legal status of generative AI art models. Several commercial model vendors are under fire from artists who allege the vendors are profiting from their work without compensating them by scraping that work from the web without permission.\n\nBut NightCafe, the generative art platform, was granted early access to DeepFloyd IF.\n\nNightCafe CEO Angus Russell spoke to TechCrunch about what makes DeepFloyd IF different from other text-to-image models and why it might represent a significant step forward for generative AI.\n\nAccording to Russell, DeepFloyd IF\u2019s design was heavily inspired by Google\u2019s Imagen model, which was never released publicly. In contrast to models like OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, DeepFloyd IF uses multiple different processes stacked together in a modular architecture to generate images.\n\nWith a typical diffusion model, the model learns how to gradually subtract noise from a starting image made almost entirely of noise, moving it closer step by step to the target prompt. DeepFloyd IF performs diffusion not once but several times, generating a 64x64px image then upscaling the image to 256x256px and finally to 1024x1024px.\n\nWhy the need for multiple diffusion steps? DeepFloyd IF works directly with pixels, Russell explained. Diffusion models are for the most part latent diffusion models, which essentially means they work in a lower-dimensional space that represents a lot more pixels but in a less accurate way.\n\nThe other key difference between DeepFloyd IF and models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 is that the former uses a large language model to understand and represent prompts as a vector, a basic data structure. Due to the size of the large language model embedded in DeepFloyd IF\u2019s architecture, the model is particularly good at understanding complex prompts and even spatial relationships described in prompts (e.g. \u201ca red cube on top of a pink sphere\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also very good at generating legible and correctly spelled text in images, and can even understand prompts in multiple languages,\u201d Russell added. \u201cOf these capabilities, the ability to generate legible text in images is perhaps the biggest breakthrough to make DeepFloyd IF stand out from other algorithms.\u201d\n\nBecause DeepFloyd IF can pretty capably generate text in images, Russell expects it to unlock a wave of new generative art possibilities \u2014 think logo design, web design, posters, billboards and even memes.

This affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default.\n\nAside from this, DeepFloyd IF, like other open source generative models, could be used for harm, like generating pornographic celebrity deepfakes and graphic depictions of violence. On the official webpage for DeepFloyd IF, the DeepFloyd team says that they used \u201ccustom filters\u201d to remove watermarked, \u201cNSFW\u201d and \u201cother inappropriate content\u201d from the training data.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear exactly which content was removed \u2014 and how much might\u2019ve been missed.

There\u2019s no better digest for the person on the go, we\u2019d argue \u2014 but of course, we\u2019re a little biased.\n\nBefore we get into the meat of the thing, a quick reminder that TC City Spotlight: Atlanta is fast approaching. On June 7, TechCrunch is headed to Atlanta, where we\u2019ll host a pitch competition, a talk on the economics of equality, a panel discussion on investing in the Atlanta ecosystem and more.\n\nElsewhere, there\u2019s a TechCrunch Live event with Persona and Index Ventures on May 10, which will touch on how Persona keeps pace with new threats and how Index made a prescient move to spot and back Persona early on. And we have Disrupt in San Francisco from September 19\u201321 \u2014 our annual conference is jam-packed with expert-led sessions and interviews with movers and shakers in the tech space.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, here\u2019s the top headlines.\n\nmost read\n\nAmazon debuts free channels: Amazon is doubling down on free, ad-supported content with this week\u2019s introduction of Fire TV Channels. The new, free and ad-supported video experience, which came to Fire TV devices this week, will be continuously updated throughout the day and integrated into several areas across the Fire TV interface, Sarah reports.\n\nBio update for a check: Briefly, a bug on Twitter let legacy blue check holders get their badge back by updating their bio. Readers will recall that blue checks on Twitter once signified that a user was \u201cverified,\u201d but now serve as an indication that they\u2019re paying for Twitter\u2019s premium subscription service, Twitter Blue. Verified users who chose not to pay recently faced the prospect of blue check removal \u2014 but not necessarily permanently, judging by the bug.\n\nGoogle ditches passwords for passkeys: This week Google rolled out passkeys to Google Account users globally, roughly a year after the company \u2014 alongside Apple, Microsoft and the FIDO Alliance \u2014 announced a partnership to broadly advance passkey adoption. With passkeys, users\u2019 authentication synchronizes across devices through the cloud using cryptographic key pairs, allowing them to sign in to websites and apps using the same biometrics or screen-lock PIN they use to unlock their devices.\n\nMicrosoft debuts Pegasus: Microsoft this week announced that it\u2019ll extend the Startup Founders Hub, its self-service platform that provides founders with free resources, including Azure credits, with a new incubator program called the Pegasus Program. Pegasus will select startups with products that \u201cfill a market need\u201d and give them up to $350,000 in Azure, GitHub and LinkedIn credits plus backing from advisors, as well as \u201caccess to the best Microsoft tech,\u201d Microsoft says.\n\nBlue check marks come to Gmail: Google is going to start displaying a blue check mark next to select senders\u2019 names on Gmail to verify their identity, the company said on Wednesday. The check marks will automatically appear next to companies that have adopted Gmail\u2019s existing brand indicators for message identification feature, reports Aisha.\n\nOpenAI rakes in the dough: OpenAI, the startup behind the widely used conversational AI model ChatGPT, has picked up new backers. In an exclusive report, Jagmeet and Ingrid reveal that VC firms, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive, K2 Global and Founders Fund, have put just over $300 million into OpenAI, valuing the company at between $27 billion and $29 billion.\n\nApple releases security fix: On Monday, Apple released its first batch of publicly available \u201crapid security\u201d patches, aimed at quickly fixing security vulnerabilities that are under active exploitation or pose significant risks to its customers. Apple says that these patches, which are enabled by default, were intended to let customers update their devices faster than a typical software upgrade.\n\nMusk settles for less: A defamation case brought against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk by critic Randeep Hothi is coming to a close, reportedly costing the billionaire ten big ones.

This week, the Equity folks covered First Republic Bank, Poparazzi\u2019s shutdown, Databricks\u2019 acquisition, who\u2019s going head-to-head with Stripe, the rise of down rounds and why Bluesky had them feeling less gray. Meanwhile, Found spoke with Stefan Bauer about how his company, Marker Learning, is cutting the cost of learning disability assessments by conducting them remotely. Chain Reaction interviewed Jake Chervinsky, the chief policy officer at Blockchain Association, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting \u201cpro-innovation\u201d policy for the digital asset world. On The TechCrunch Podcast \u2014 which, like WiR, covers the week in tech news \u2014 Devin talked about whether Meta\u2019s cavalier approach to compliance might finally be coming to a close. And last but not least, TechCrunch Live profiled Sam Chaudhary, the founder of ClassDojo, and Chris Farmer, the founder and CEO of SignalFire, about playing the long game in edtech, investing in companies that aren\u2019t rushing to monetize and the \u201coutsider advantage.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch+\n\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber. If you\u2019re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week:\n\nA cloudy future: Lyft\u2019s equity is selling off in the wake of the U.S. ride-hailing giant\u2019s first-quarter results and its comments regarding the current quarter, and how its new strategic posture will affect its growth and economics in the coming quarters. But there\u2019s not necessarily cause for panic. Alex and Anna write about Lyft\u2019s new tack and the potential upsides, of which there are several.\n\nDown but not out: For the past year, everyone\u2019s been predicting that the muted exit environment and bone-dry funding market would bring a reckoning for many late-stage companies. Down rounds carry a negative connotation and are often interpreted as the fault of the company or founder. But in a market where everything seems to be heading downward, they shouldn\u2019t imply a company or its founders made a mistake \u2014 you often simply can\u2019t help it, Rebecca writes.\n\nChatGPT, meet edtech: Shares of edtech company Chegg fell off a cliff this week even after the company reported Q1 results that bested analyst expectations. In its earnings call, the company\u2019s executives noted that ChatGPT was slowing its ability to add new subscribers, not only potentially slowing growth but also throwing uncertainty into its ability to predict its future financial results.

However, downloads are continuing to grow, up 11% year-over-year in 2022 to reach 255 billion. Consumers are also spending more time in mobile apps than ever before. On Android devices alone, hours spent in 2022 grew 9%, reaching 4.1 trillion.\n\nThis Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.\n\nDo you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday?

As TechCrunch\u2019s Darrell Etherington reported, Dorsey responded to questions posed to him from other users and reporters on Bluesky, including one where he was asked if Musk has proven to be the best possible steward for the social network.\n\nDorsey said he had not:\n\nNo. Nor do I think he acted right after realizing his timing was bad. Nor do I think the board should have forced the sale. It all went south. But it happened and all we can do now is build something to avoid that ever happening again. So I\u2019m happy Jay and team and nostr devs exist and building it.\n\nHowever, the Twitter co-founder stressed that Twitter would have never survived as a public company and defended himself from an accusation that he was deflecting blame for Twitter\u2019s current situation.\n\nThough Bluesky is having a moment, particularly as a haven for marginalized groups, sex workers and trans users, it\u2019s not the only Twitter alternative Dorsey is now backing. In fact, he\u2019s been more active in recent days on the social network nostr (which he also financially backed), where he\u2019s also been critical of some of Musk\u2019s recent decisions. For example, as The NYT reported, Dorsey posted last month \u201cThis is weak,\u201d in response to Musk\u2019s move to stop Twitter users from linking to Substack after it launched a Twitter-like service for its own community of writers and readers.\n\nDorsey also touted his belief in these platforms during Block\u2019s recent earnings call, suggesting on his nostr profile this may be the first time the network\u2019s name had been mentioned during a public earnings event.\n\n\u201cOpen protocols represent another fork in the road moment for people and companies,\u201d Dorsey told investors. \u201cBitcoin, nostr, Bluesky, web5 and others are all working to level the playing field for competition and give individuals and organizations entirely new capabilities,\u201d he added.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Bluesky has been gaining traction, but the network has been difficult to access due to its invite-only nature. That\u2019s turned Bluesky invites into hot commodities, where they\u2019re even selling for hundreds of dollars on eBay, as most users have to wait to receive only one invite every two weeks.\n\nBluesky leadership will also sometimes gift a user with a larger number of invites in order to have them invite members of a specific community. Developers who can demonstrate they\u2019re building a Bluesky app may also request additional invites, we understand.\n\nThe network has received outsized press coverage relative to its size \u2014 just 50,000+ users \u2014 possibly because of the heavy infusion of tech journalists on there and Dorsey\u2019s name attached. But the reality is that Bluesky\u2019s future remains uncertain. The company, for now, is able to build and grow thanks to the $13 million in initial funds it received from Twitter, where it was incubated under Dorsey\u2019s leadership. It has since spun out into its own, independent company (a public benefit LLC). It\u2019s unclear how Bluesky intends to maintain its operations in the long term, not to mention its freewheeling culture and accepting community. Networks can often be pleasant and welcoming when small, like Bluesky \u2014 or early Twitter, for that matter \u2014 but face challenges once they scale to millions of users.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4442, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2216e9d4-6174-412f-946e-9af75efaeca9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2216e9d4-6174-412f-946e-9af75efaeca9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-06-this-week-in-apps-apple-and-google-team-up-on-trackers-google-i-o-preview-apps-hit-newfronts.txt", "file_name": "05-06-this-week-in-apps-apple-and-google-team-up-on-trackers-google-i-o-preview-apps-hit-newfronts.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 28949, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd226f8a-8ad9-4f2e-afbf-aa81b5c1f86f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-06-this-week-in-apps-apple-and-google-team-up-on-trackers-google-i-o-preview-apps-hit-newfronts.txt", "file_name": "05-06-this-week-in-apps-apple-and-google-team-up-on-trackers-google-i-o-preview-apps-hit-newfronts.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 28949, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "951e81a42942850086b1a06706f99263545713bed7ddefded5420c904dbbae9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46bcd283-84bc-4b8c-84d4-6c4af0eaf003", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-06-this-week-in-apps-apple-and-google-team-up-on-trackers-google-i-o-preview-apps-hit-newfronts.txt", "file_name": "05-06-this-week-in-apps-apple-and-google-team-up-on-trackers-google-i-o-preview-apps-hit-newfronts.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 28949, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "56203cb81cef55dc2bbd025b510e27ef69c42451dfcfd781cf7a8155de8ba1a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "518ac5ae-fdc0-4fc2-a082-db39085a1dc1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb949fbad22cd66d9206e2baec6ddb1760af3a780c08f35ab0069fb7254e4b32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d9464f73f9f54f47d6bf0c6be2880fda7f020ba0f31fe31301b29c3476f4175e", "text": "Developers who can demonstrate they\u2019re building a Bluesky app may also request additional invites, we understand.\n\nThe network has received outsized press coverage relative to its size \u2014 just 50,000+ users \u2014 possibly because of the heavy infusion of tech journalists on there and Dorsey\u2019s name attached.

Within two and a half months, at the height of the worsening global economy, they had secured $200 million. It\u2019s the fourth marquee fund for the Bengaluru-headquartered fund, whose portfolio includes four unicorn startups.\n\nThe fund, sixth overall for 3one4 Capital, was oversubscribed to $250 million but the firm is accepting only $200 million to keep itself lean and disciplined, said Pranav Pai, co-founder and partner at 3one4 Capital. The firm\u2019s decision to limit the fund size is emblematic of its strategic choices, which have set it apart from other Indian venture firms.\n\n\u201cWe are known to give good returns. Our performance has been benchmarked among the best leading performing funds in the space. So we asked ourselves the hard questions, can we continue our performance with a larger fund size? Do we even need that much capital for the early-stage?\u201d said Pai in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nIn recent years, a surge of venture capital firms in India have raised unprecedentedly large funds, sparking concerns about the responsible allocation of this capital, particularly for early-stage startups. Critics question whether there are enough viable companies in the Indian market to absorb and effectively utilize such significant investments.\n\nPai, pictured above, asserts that there is ample room for more Indian companies to pursue IPOs, as the nation\u2019s IPO market has proven successful and well-regulated for institutional investors. He anticipates a transformation in India\u2019s stock index, with an increasing number of tech companies, apps, services, fintech, and payment solutions becoming part of the index.\n\nDespite this, Pai acknowledges that the Indian market has yet to fully realize its potential for mergers and acquisitions. Although there has been growth in M&A activity\u2014increasing three to four times in the past five years\u2014it remains below expectations. For the Indian market to flourish, Pai emphasizes the need for a more robust M&A landscape.\n\nOver the last half-decade, numerous Indian venture firms have shifted their attention to early-stage investments. Despite this increased focus, the market continues to depend on international investors to support mid- and growth-stage deals, highlighting the need for further growth in India\u2019s venture capital ecosystem. \u201cWe have high performing mutual funds and PEs. We hope that more of these firms will launch dedicated funds for Indian startups,\u201d he said.\n\nHalf of the capital in the new fund for 3one4 has come from Indian investors, another aspect that differentiates the firm from many of its peers. All the systemically important Indian banks, and the top five local banks by market cap overall have invested in the new fund. Eight of the top 10 mutual fund operators are also LPs in the new fund, said Pai. \u201cWe are also proud to have leading global endowments, sovereigns and insurance companies as LPs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to be India\u2019s leading homegrown venture capital firm. We are based here, we invest here \u2013 we don\u2019t want to invest in Southeast Asia \u2013 and our fund size and strategy are aligned with opportunities in India. As our companies have IPO-ed over the years, we have seen the importance of having India\u2019s largest institutions working with us to help build those companies. It would be difficult if we didn\u2019t have banks to help our companies from everything from revenue collection to payrolls.

Every week, we\u2019ll take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There\u2019s a lot of fintech news out there and it\u2019s our job to stay on top of it \u2014 and make sense of it \u2014 so you can stay in the know. \u2014 Mary Ann and Christine\n\nBusy, busy, busy\n\nIt was a busy week in startup and venture lands, and the fintech space was no exception.\n\nIn the venture world, I reported on Peter Ackerson\u2019s departure from Fin Capital earlier this year and the fact that he has since started a new venture firm called Audere Capital. The circumstances around his departure remain fuzzy, but one source speculated that tension arose between Ackerson and Fin founding partner Logan Allin over some of the goings-on at alternative financing startup Pipe last year. More details here.\n\nWe also wrote about Tellus, a startup that raised $16 million in an Andreessen Horowitz\u2013led seed round of funding last year that is now being scrutinized by the U.S. government. When I interviewed the company\u2019s co-founder, Rocky Lee, last year, I admit I was a little bit skeptical of any company that would bet on people agreeing to high-interest mortgage rates to upgrade their homes (think 9%!) and using customer savings deposits to fund such loans. When I asked Lee if this was risky, he admitted it was but insisted that Tellus utilized \u201cvery strict underwriting criteria\u201d and had not yet seen any defaults \u201cbecause the majority of its borrowers go on to soon refinance their loans at more favorable terms.\u201d Well, last week U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wrote a letter to FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg expressing concerns about Tellus\u2019s claims. In that letter, Brown pressed the FDIC to review Tellus\u2019s business practices \u201cto ensure that customers are protected from financial fraud and abuse.\u201d In a twist, I discovered that Lee was married to a16z general partner Connie Chan (not sure if he still is). Neither he nor the venture firm commented on the senator\u2019s concerns but Tellus CEO/CTO Jeromee Johnson did provide me with a statement via email. Read more here.\n\nInfrastructure continues to be resilient, even in a downturn. This week alone, I wrote about two payments infrastructure companies making moves, and my colleague Ingrid Lunden wrote about Stripe\u2019s latest customer win. For starters, I covered Finix officially becoming a payments processor \u2014 a natural evolution really for a company that has slowly been expanding its offerings. In case you forgot, Finix is a startup that Sequoia backtracked on investing in after Stripe (an existing portfolio company) expressed concerns about being too competitive. (Finix got to keep its $21 million, though!) Now that it directly connects to all major U.S. card networks \u2014 American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa \u2014 and no longer relies on a third-party processor, Finix says it\u2019s able to offer businesses \u201cinstant onboarding, improved economics and opportunities for lowering interchange fees.\u201d I talked with CEO and co-founder Richie Serna all about it, and why he thinks what Finix has built is different from what legacy players and Stripe have on the market. I also wrote about Liquido, a Mountain View, California\u2013based startup aiming to be the \u201cStripe of Latin America,\u201d and more. Index Ventures\u2019 Mark Fiorentino led two funding rounds totaling $26 million into the company in 2021. Interestingly, prior to joining Index, Fiorentino helped build and lead business strategy and finance at Stripe from 2015 to 2019. And Ingrid wrote about Stripe landing Uber as a customer, which was a bit unexpected considering that rival Lyft has been a longtime marquee customer of the company.\n\nAnd, last but not least, corporate card and spend management startup Brex announced last week a global expansion of its Empower product into new markets so that companies that are its customers now \u201ccan spend globally and operate locally\u201d in countries such as Brazil, Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, and the Philippines, as well as in 36 European countries.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4457, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a08baec2-ea2c-497a-aa57-382a698df994": {"__data__": {"id_": "a08baec2-ea2c-497a-aa57-382a698df994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-07-fintech-space-continues-to-be-competitive-and-drama-filled.txt", "file_name": "05-07-fintech-space-continues-to-be-competitive-and-drama-filled.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11158, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2072243-564b-41d2-ba00-268975c5be63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-07-fintech-space-continues-to-be-competitive-and-drama-filled.txt", "file_name": "05-07-fintech-space-continues-to-be-competitive-and-drama-filled.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11158, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "42a05500475f0844920992183b686716ad532bb6a200d9ab325148ab223938be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "12c0db50-796f-4ccd-90d7-5c5aa5432fb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/new_articles/05-07-fintech-space-continues-to-be-competitive-and-drama-filled.txt", "file_name": "05-07-fintech-space-continues-to-be-competitive-and-drama-filled.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 11158, "creation_date": "2024-01-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-05-08", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-08"}, "hash": "6856125aee3feec1478571a4a62da86f7ffb2a44b0e3fbeb3949ef095bf4e988", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a8ee61a-668a-4d83-9360-df5108e80e23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f376e491c7e8f92422b20e2a6d212ebf89043c0e2ed899540ad1a1faf8eeae13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "25d755be9be473c248904c1c2988dd9f4c905660f9708e2bd9fb4e22884880cb", "text": "I also wrote about Liquido, a Mountain View, California\u2013based startup aiming to be the \u201cStripe of Latin America,\u201d and more.

In an interview with TechCrunch, Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras said that the company believes the move \u201cwill really open up TAM\u201d for Brex since so many existing and prospective U.S. clients \u201chave some sort of global operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the big problems that companies have when they operate globally is that they actually need to open up an account in all these different countries where they might have employees. It becomes really complicated to set up all your financial systems on a country by country basis,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, if you use Brex, you can actually operate as if you were a local company with a local card.\u201d\n\nIn other words, companies using Brex that have employees who work in other countries are giving those workers the ability to use a corporate card freely in their home countries, while also giving the company the ability to pay the statements in local currency from the local bank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been trying to do for a while,\u201d Dubugras added, noting that insurtech Lemonade is a customer. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nOther weekly news\n\nChristine, Mary Ann and Natasha Mascarenhas teamed up to write about the collapse of First Republic Bank, speaking with tech founders and investors who had money in the bank about what happens next.

A ransomware group called RansomHouse claimed responsibility for the recent cyberattack on AvidXchange.\u201d More here.\n\nChristine wrote about the launch of former Bolt CEO Ryan Breslow\u2019s new company, Love, which is a wellness marketplace that features an initial 200 curated products, like supplements, health testing kits and essential oils, among such categories as reducing stress and gut health. All of the products on the site pass a set of compliance processes and reviews developed in partnership with clinical trials company Radicle Science, which Breslow said is unique to the company.
